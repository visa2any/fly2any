## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES / LIMITATIONS

### Expected Limitations:

   - ⚠️ Alternative airports show estimated prices (not live searches)
   - ⚠️ Seat map is mock layout (not real aircraft configuration)
   - ✅ All mock data is realistic and functional

2. **API Integration Pending**:
   - ⏳ Real price calendar API not connected
   - ⏳ Real alternative airport search not connected
   - ⏳ Real seat map data not connected
   - ✅ All components ready to receive real data

3. **Passenger Count**:
   - ℹ️ Baggage calculator currently hardcoded to 1 adult
   - ⏳ Need to pass actual passenger count from search params
   - ✅ Component supports multiple passengers (just needs wiring)

4. **Deal Score Breakdown**:
   - ℹ️ Badge shows total score, not full breakdown in tooltip
   - ✅ Breakdown data exists in flight objects
   - ⏳ Tooltip hover may need enhancement for full details
