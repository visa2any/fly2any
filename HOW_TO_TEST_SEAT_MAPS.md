## 🎯 3 Ways to See REAL Seat Maps

### Option 1: Use Duffel Airways (GUARANTEED TO WORK)

**Duffel Airways** is Duffel's own test airline with FULL seat map support.

1. **Open your browser** → http://localhost:3000

2. **Search for Duffel Airways flight**:
   - From: **LHR** (London Heathrow)
   - To: **JFK** (New York)
   - Date: Any future date (3+ months recommended)
   - Passengers: 1
   - Class: Economy or Business

3. **In search results**:
   - Look for flights with **"Duffel Airways"** airline
   - IATA code: **ZZ**
   - These flights WILL have seat maps!

4. **Click "Select"** → **Proceed to booking**

5. **Click "View Interactive Seat Map"**

**Expected Result**:
```terminal
🪑 FETCHING DUFFEL SEAT MAPS (Direct HTTP API)
✅ Duffel API response received (HTTP 200)
   Seat maps returned: 2  ← SHOULD SEE THIS!
🪑 First seat map structure: { id: 'smp_xxxxx', cabinsCount: 1 }
✅ SUCCESS: Parsed 2 seat map(s) with REAL airline data
```

### Option 2: Use American Airlines (Recommended by Duffel)

According to Duffel documentation:

1. **Search for**:
   - From: **DFW** (Dallas/Fort Worth)
   - To: **AUS** (Austin)
   - Date: **3 months from today**
   - Class: Economy

2. **Select American Airlines flight** (look for AA code)

3. **Click "View Interactive Seat Map"**

**Why this route?**
> "Duffel recommends using an offer from American Airlines... searching with one slice from DFW (Dallas) to AUS (Austin), about three months from today's date."

---

### Option 3: Use Production Duffel Token (Real Data)

For REAL Emirates seat maps, you need a **production token**:

1. **Sign up for Duffel paid account**: https://app.duffel.com/join

2. **Get production token**:
   - Go to Duffel Dashboard
   - API Keys → Create Production Key
   - Copy token (starts with `duffel_live_`)

3. **Update `.env.local`**:
   ```env
   # Change from:
   DUFFEL_ACCESS_TOKEN=duffel_test_YOUR_OLD_TOKEN_HERE

   # To:
   DUFFEL_ACCESS_TOKEN=duffel_live_YOUR_PRODUCTION_TOKEN_HERE
   ```

4. **Restart dev server**

5. **Now search for Emirates** (JFK → DXB)
   - Will show REAL seat maps
   - Will show REAL pricing
   - Will have REAL availability

**⚠️ Warning**: Production API charges per order:
- $3/order + 1% order value + $2/ancillary
- Only use for real bookings or final testing

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Testing Instructions

### Test #1: Verify Code Works (Duffel Airways)

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+R)

2. **Go to**: http://localhost:3000

3. **Search**:
   ```
   From: LHR
   To: JFK
   Depart: 3 months from today
   Passengers: 1
   Class: Economy
   ```

4. **Find Duffel Airways flight** (airline code: ZZ)

5. **Click Select** → **Proceed to booking**

6. **Click "View Interactive Seat Map"**

7. **Check terminal** for:
   ```
   ✅ Duffel API response received (HTTP 200)
      Seat maps returned: 2  ← MUST SEE 2!
   ✅ SUCCESS: Parsed 2 seat map(s) with REAL airline data
   ```

8. **In browser**: Interactive seat map should open with:
   - Real cabin layout
   - Available/occupied seats (green/red)
   - Seat pricing
   - Ability to select seats

**If this works** ✅ = Your code is perfect! Just need production token for Emirates.

**If this doesn't work** ❌ = There's still a code issue (very unlikely based on terminal logs).

### Test #2: Try American Airlines (If Available)

1. **Search**:
   ```
   From: DFW
   To: AUS
   Depart: 3 months from today
   Passengers: 1
   Class: Economy
   ```

2. **Select American Airlines flight** (AA)

3. **Try seat map**

4. **Check results**:
   - May or may not have seat maps (test environment is unpredictable)
   - If available, great! If not, that's normal for test mode

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Still seeing 0 seat maps with Duffel Airways"

**Possible causes**:
1. No Duffel Airways flights in search results
   - Try different date (further out)
   - Try business class instead of economy

2. Selected wrong airline
   - Double-check airline code is "ZZ"
   - Look for "Duffel Airways" in airline name

3. Offer expired
   - Offers expire after 30 minutes
   - Search again for fresh offer

### Issue: "Can't find Duffel Airways flights"

Duffel Airways may not appear in all searches. Try:
- Longer routes (international)
- Different dates
- Different cabin classes
- The documented route: LHR → JFK

Or skip to Option 2 (American Airlines) or Option 3 (Production token).

   - Need production Duffel token (`duffel_live_`)
   - Or test with Duffel Airways (ZZ) to verify code works

4. **The implementation is correct** ✅
   - Direct HTTP requests working
   - Error handling proper
   - Response parsing correct

## 🎯 Quick Checklist

Before saying "it doesn't work", verify:

- [ ] Tested with **Duffel Airways (ZZ)** airline
- [ ] Used **LHR → JFK** route or **DFW → AUS** route
- [ ] Date is **3+ months** in the future
- [ ] Terminal shows `Seat maps returned: X` where **X > 0**
- [ ] Browser cache cleared (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Dev server restarted after code changes

If ALL these are checked and you still see 0 seat maps on Duffel Airways, then contact me with the terminal logs.
