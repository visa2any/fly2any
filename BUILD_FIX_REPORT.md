# 🔧 BUILD FIX REPORT - VERCEL DEPLOYMENT

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Missing PostgreSQL Dependency
**Problem:** Module not found: Can't resolve 'pg'
**Solution:** Installed `pg@8.16.3` and `@types/pg@8.15.5`
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### 2. Dependencies Installed
```json
"pg": "^8.16.3",
"@types/pg": "^8.15.5"
```

### 3. Files Verified
- ✅ `src/lib/email-marketing-db.ts` - Uses pg module
- ✅ `src/lib/email-auto-restart.ts` - Imports from email-marketing-db
- ✅ `src/app/api/cron/email-auto-restart/route.ts` - Uses email-auto-restart

## 📦 DEPLOYMENT STATUS

### Changes Pushed
- **Commit:** `ed40f7b` - Add missing pg dependency for production build
- **Branch:** main
- **Status:** Successfully pushed to GitHub

### What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Added missing `pg` package for PostgreSQL connections
2. ✅ Added TypeScript types for pg
3. ✅ Updated Mailgun configuration
4. ✅ Removed exposed API keys from documentation

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

The Vercel deployment should now proceed without the "Module not found: Can't resolve 'pg'" error.

### Expected Build Result
- The build should complete successfully
- All dependencies are now properly installed
- TypeScript types are configured

### If Build Still Fails
Check for:
1. Environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Database connection string validity
3. Any other missing dependencies

## 📊 PROJECT INTEGRITY
