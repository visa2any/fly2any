## Detailed Breakdown

### 1. ✅ BAGGAGE - Real Data Available

**Status**: **REAL DATA when airline provides it**

#### How It Works:

1. **Duffel Flights** (source: 'Duffel'):
   - First tries to fetch real-time baggage from Duffel API
   - Gets actual airline prices and descriptions
   - Falls back to Amadeus extraction if Duffel fails

2. **Amadeus/GDS Flights**:
   - Extracts baggage amenities from fare details
   - Uses real prices when airline includes them in amenities array
   - Falls back to estimated pricing if no amenities data

#### Console Log Examples:

**When Real Data is Found:**
```
🧳 ========================================
🧳 EXTRACTING BAGGAGE FROM AMADEUS FARE DETAILS
🧳 Included checked bags: 1
🧳 Baggage amenities found in fare details: 2
✅ FOUND REAL BAGGAGE AMENITIES IN FARE:
   1. First checked bag - USD 35 ✅ (Real price)
   2. Second checked bag - USD 45 ✅ (Real price)
✅ Extracted 2 baggage options from Amadeus amenities
🧳 ========================================

📊 ANCILLARY DATA SOURCES:
   🧳 Baggage: ✅ REAL AIRLINE DATA
```

**When Falling Back to Estimates:**
```
🧳 ========================================
🧳 EXTRACTING BAGGAGE FROM AMADEUS FARE DETAILS
🧳 Included checked bags: 0
🧳 Baggage amenities found in fare details: 0
⚠️  NO BAGGAGE AMENITIES FOUND IN FARE DETAILS
⚠️  Using standard estimated pricing:
   - Checked Bag 1: USD 35 (Estimated)
   - Checked Bag 2: USD 45 (Estimated)
   - Extra Bag: USD 65 (Estimated)
⚠️  Generated 3 estimated baggage options
🧳 ========================================

📊 ANCILLARY DATA SOURCES:
   🧳 Baggage: ⚠️  MOCK/ESTIMATED DATA
```

#### What to Look For:
- ✅ **"REAL AIRLINE DATA"** = Actual airline pricing
- ⚠️ **"MOCK/ESTIMATED DATA"** = Standard industry estimates

---

### 2. ✅ SEAT MAPS - Real Data Available

**Status**: **REAL DATA when airline provides it**

#### How It Works:

- Separate API endpoint: `/api/flights/seat-map`
- Fetches interactive seat maps from Duffel or Amadeus
- Not all airlines provide seat maps (this is normal)
- Graceful fallback to seat type selection

#### Console Log Examples:

**When Seat Map Available:**
```
📍 Fetching seat map for flight: off_0000AzgZ7jL0uN8FJJadfT
✅ Seat map loaded successfully
```

**When Seat Map Not Available:**
```
📍 Fetching seat map for flight: off_0000AzgZ7jL0uN8FJJadfT
⚠️  Seat map not available: Failed to get seat map
```

**User Experience:**
- If available: Interactive seat map opens
- If not available: User-friendly alert directs to seat type selection
- Message: *"Interactive seat map is not available for this airline. You can still select your preferred seat type from the options above."*

#### What to Expect:
- **Budget airlines**: Often don't provide seat maps
- **Major carriers**: Usually provide seat maps
- **Regional flights**: Varies by airline
- **This is normal behavior** - not a bug!

### 3. ⚠️ SEATS (Selection) - Mock Data

**Status**: **MOCK DATA** (static pricing)

#### Why Mock?

The basic seat selection in the ancillaries tab uses standard pricing for simplicity:
- Aisle Seat: $15
- Window Seat: $15
- Extra Legroom: $45

#### Real Alternative Available:

Real seat data is available through the **interactive seat map** (see section 2 above). The seat map shows:
- Exact seat numbers
- Real-time availability
- Actual airline pricing per seat
- Cabin layout

#### In Your Console:
```
📊 ANCILLARY DATA SOURCES:
   💺 Seats: ⚠️  MOCK DATA (Interactive seat maps available separately)
```

---

### 4. ⚠️ OTHER SERVICES - Mock Data

#### Meals
- **Status**: Mock data
- **Why**: Requires airline-specific API integration
- **Pricing**: Estimated based on industry standards
- **Future**: Can integrate with airline catering APIs

#### WiFi
- **Status**: Mock data
- **Why**: Not available in Amadeus/Duffel test APIs
- **Pricing**: Estimated ($12 standard)
- **Future**: Some airlines provide WiFi SKUs

#### Insurance
- **Status**: Mock data (calculated)
- **Why**: Requires 3rd party insurance provider integration
- **Pricing**: Calculated as % of flight price (5%, 8%, 12%)
- **Future**: Integrate with providers like Allianz, Travel Guard

#### Lounge Access
- **Status**: Mock data
- **Why**: Requires airport/lounge API integration
- **Pricing**: Estimated ($45 standard)
- **Future**: Integrate with Priority Pass, LoungeKey

#### Priority Services
- **Status**: Mock data
- **Why**: Requires airline-specific API integration
- **Pricing**: Estimated ($15-$25)
- **Future**: Available through airline-specific APIs

## Testing Recommendations

### To Test Real Baggage Data:

1. **Search for flights** on popular routes
2. **Check console logs** for:
   - `✅ FOUND REAL BAGGAGE AMENITIES IN FARE`
   - `✅ REAL AIRLINE DATA`

3. **Expected Results**:
   - Major airlines (Delta, United, BA, etc.): Often provide real data
   - Budget airlines (Ryanair, Spirit, etc.): May provide real data
   - Regional carriers: Varies

### To Test Seat Maps:

1. **Select a flight** and proceed to booking
2. **Click "View Interactive Seat Map"** button
3. **Check console** for:
   - `✅ Seat map loaded successfully` = Real data
   - `⚠️  Seat map not available` = Expected for some airlines

### What's Normal:

- **Not all airlines provide seat maps** - this is industry standard
- **Budget airlines often skip seat maps** - they sell seats separately
- **Regional flights may not have seat maps** - smaller aircraft
- **Fallback to seat type selection always works** - guaranteed UX

---

## Summary

### What's Working:

✅ **Baggage**: Real data when airline provides it, smart fallbacks
✅ **Seat Maps**: Real interactive maps when airline supports it
✅ **Logging**: Comprehensive visibility into data sources
✅ **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation, never broken UX
✅ **User Experience**: Clear messaging when real data unavailable

### What's Mock (By Design):

⚠️ **Meals, WiFi, Insurance, Lounge, Priority**: Standard estimates
⚠️ **Reason**: These require additional API integrations
⚠️ **User Impact**: Minimal - users see consistent pricing
⚠️ **Future**: Can integrate real data as needed

### Console Output Interpretation:

Look for these key phrases in your console:
- `✅ REAL AIRLINE DATA` = You're getting actual airline prices
- `⚠️  MOCK/ESTIMATED DATA` = Using industry standard estimates
- `⚠️  Seat map not available` = Normal for many airlines

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

If you want to add more real data sources in the future:

1. **Meals**: Integrate airline catering APIs (airline-specific)
2. **WiFi**: Request WiFi SKUs from airlines (limited availability)
3. **Insurance**: Integrate with travel insurance providers (Allianz, etc.)
4. **Lounge**: Integrate with Priority Pass or LoungeKey APIs
5. **Priority**: Request priority service SKUs from airlines

**Current Status**: Your platform is production-ready with excellent data quality for core services (baggage, seat maps) and reasonable estimates for supplementary services.

## Questions?

If you see unexpected behavior, check console logs for:
1. Which data source is being used (Duffel vs Amadeus)
2. Whether real data was found or fallback used
3. Specific error messages (if any)

**Remember**: Not seeing a seat map or having estimated baggage prices for some flights is NORMAL airline industry behavior, not a bug! The logging now makes this transparent.
