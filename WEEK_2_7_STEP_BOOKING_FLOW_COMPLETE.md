      {/* Flight details rendering... */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

  // Combined payment + review step
  return Boolean(
    formData.payment.cardNumber &&
    formData.payment.cardName &&
    // ... all payment fields
    termsAccepted // ‚úÖ Terms must be accepted
  );
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### **Type System Updates**

**Before:**
```tsx
type BookingStep = 'passengers' | 'seats' | 'payment' | 'review';
```

**After:**
```tsx
type BookingStep = 'summary' | 'fares' | 'seats' | 'baggage' | 'bundles' | 'passengers' | 'payment';
```

---

### **Step Indicator Component**

**Updated to show all 7 steps:**
```tsx
const steps: { key: BookingStep; icon: typeof User; label: string }[] = [
  { key: 'summary', icon: Plane, label: t.steps.summary },
  { key: 'fares', icon: CheckCircle, label: t.steps.fares },
  { key: 'seats', icon: MapPin, label: t.steps.seats },
  { key: 'baggage', icon: Shield, label: t.steps.baggage },
  { key: 'bundles', icon: Calendar, label: t.steps.bundles },
  { key: 'passengers', icon: User, label: t.steps.passengers },
  { key: 'payment', icon: CreditCard, label: t.steps.payment },
];
```

**Visual Progress:**
- Completed steps: Green checkmark
- Current step: Primary color with ring effect
- Future steps: Gray
- Clickable back navigation on completed steps

---

### **Navigation Logic**

**Updated step array:**
```tsx
const steps: BookingStep[] = ['summary', 'fares', 'seats', 'baggage', 'bundles', 'passengers', 'payment'];
```

**Validation per step:**
- `summary`: Always valid (just reviewing)
- `fares`: Always valid (optional)
- `seats`: Always valid (optional)
- `baggage`: Always valid (optional)
- `bundles`: Always valid (optional)
- `passengers`: Required fields validated
- `payment`: Payment + terms required

---

### **Initial State**

**Changed from:**
```tsx
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState<BookingStep>('passengers');
```

**To:**
```tsx
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState<BookingStep>('summary');
```

**Why:** User should see flight summary first before making any decisions

---

### **Multi-Language Support**

**All 3 languages updated:**
- English (`en`)
- Portuguese (`pt`)
- Spanish (`es`)

**Translation structure:**
```tsx
steps: {
  summary: 'Flight Summary',
  fares: 'Choose Fare',
  seats: 'Select Seats',
  baggage: 'Add Baggage',
  bundles: 'Trip Bundles',
  passengers: 'Passenger Details',
  payment: 'Payment & Review',
},
stepLabels: {
  summary: 'Confirm your flight selection',
  fares: 'Choose your fare class',
  seats: 'Select your seats (optional)',
  // ... etc
}
```
