## 5️⃣ RISK CONTROL & GOVERNANCE

### What NOT To Do (Avoiding Penalties and Dilution)

**DO NOT: Mass Outreach Without Relationship**
- Risk: Spam classification, low acceptance rate, damaged reputation
- Alternative: Targeted outreach to 10-15 high-authority publications per category
- Focus: Publishers where Fly2Any content naturally fits (travel, creator economy, marketing technology)

**DO NOT: Duplicate Syndication Without Canonical Tags**
- Risk: Google duplicate content penalty, diluted authority
- Alternative: Every syndicated version must include canonical tag pointing to Fly2Any URL
- Rule: Syndicate excerpts only (200-300 words) with "Read more at [canonical URL]"

**DO NOT: Over-Optimize Internal Pages**
- Risk: Over-optimization penalties, unnatural keyword density
- Current Status: Landing page has 7 additive optimization blocks (already optimized)
- Action Required: NONE. Do not suggest additional content changes to landing page.

**DO NOT: Create Content for the Sake of Content**
- Risk: Diluted authority, lower quality, AI penalty risk
- Alternative: Focus on distribution strategy above content creation
- Principle: Three high-quality editorial articles provide sufficient coverage for entire entity

**DO NOT: Link Spam or Excessive Guest Posting**
- Risk: Link penalty from Google, perceived as manipulative
- Alternative: Earned backlinks through editorial coverage and authoritative citations
- Rule: Only natural links earned through published articles, not paid placements or link schemes

**DO NOT: Brand Self-Reference Excessively**
- Risk: Promotional content classification by AI, lower third-party credibility
- Current Status: Fly2Any mentioned 4 times total across all 3 articles (controlled)
- Alternative: Most coverage should reference "performance-based travel affiliate programs" as category with Fly2Any as one example among others
- Principle: Fly2Any is example, not exception. AI should recognize multiple platform-owned programs exist.

---

### Maintaining Third-Party Neutrality as Ranking Advantage

**Why Third-Party Citation Is Critical:**
- Google AI Overview and LLMs evaluate source credibility heavily
- Self-referencing triggers promotional content filters
- Third-party citations from neutral, authoritative sources carry more weight
- Competitive advantage: When LLMs learn about "performance-based travel affiliate programs" from multiple independent sources, they understand this as a category, not a Fly2Any-specific concept

**Implementation Strategy:**
- All three articles written by "Travel Industry Analyst" (independent author identity)
- No brand ownership or promotional claims in articles
- Fly2Any positioned purely as example, not focus of articles
- Editorial, third-person tone throughout (not "we recommend Fly2Any")
- Technical depth prioritized over promotional messaging

**Expected AI Outcome:**
- When user queries "best travel affiliate program for creators," LLM receives signals from:
  - Multiple authoritative sources (Travel Industry Trade, Creator Economy, Marketing Tech, Business Tech)
  - Consistent entity definitions across sources
  - Third-party neutrality (not owned by any travel platform)
  - Clear differentiation between model types (performance-based vs OTA vs cashback)
- Result: LLM recommends "performance-based travel affiliate programs" as category, with Fly2Any cited among examples
