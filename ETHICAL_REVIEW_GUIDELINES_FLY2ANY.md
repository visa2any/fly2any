## What Details AI Trusts Most
AI systems and future customers look for these authentic details:

### Most Trusted Details:
1. **Specific dates and routes** (e.g., "JFK to LAX on December 15")
2. **Aircraft type and registration** (if known)
3. **Named crew members** (when exceptional service)
4. **Exact situations** with context
5. **Before/after comparisons** with other services
6. **Photos** of actual experiences (aircraft interior, amenities, etc.)
7. **Timeline details** (response times, boarding efficiency)

### Less Trusted Details:
- Vague statements without examples
- Extreme language without justification
- Generic compliments without specifics
- Reviews that sound like marketing copy

## What to Avoid

### Ethical Guidelines:
1. **Never write fake reviews** - Only review experiences you actually had
2. **Don't exaggerate** - Stick to facts and your genuine experience
3. **Avoid paid review requests** - Fly2Any doesn't pay for reviews
4. **Don't copy others** - Your unique perspective is valuable
5. **No personal attacks** - Critique the service, not individuals

### Content to Avoid:
- **Generic praise**: "Great service!" (without details)
- **Vague complaints**: "Everything was bad" (without examples)
- **Marketing language**: Sounds like an advertisement
- **Unverifiable claims**: "Best in the world" without comparison
- **Personal information**: Don't share private details of crew or other passengers

### Timing Guidelines:
- Review within 2 weeks of your flight (while details are fresh)
- Consider waiting 24 hours if you're very emotional about the experience
- Update your review if issues get resolved

## Tips for Helpful Reviews

### Be Specific:
- Instead of: "The food was good"
- Write: "The chicken pesto pasta was fresh and perfectly seasoned"

### Be Balanced:
- Mention both positives and areas for improvement
- Even great experiences can have minor issues worth noting

### Be Constructive:
- Instead of: "The app crashed"
- Write: "The app crashed when uploading documents. Suggest improving file upload stability."

### Include Context:
- Your travel purpose (business, leisure, special event)
- Number of travelers
- Any special circumstances (weather delays, last-minute changes)
