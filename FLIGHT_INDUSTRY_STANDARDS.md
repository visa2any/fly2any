## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Key Findings

1. **Fare Complexity is Intentional**: Airlines use branded fares to create choice architecture that drives ancillary revenue while offering price-sensitive consumers basic options.

2. **Regulatory Requirements are Minimal**: US DOT mandates "full fare advertising" (all-in pricing) and fee disclosure, but doesn't regulate what must be included in base fares.

3. **Customer Confusion Peaks at Basic Economy**: The #1 source of customer complaints is not understanding Basic Economy restrictions, especially around baggage and seat assignment.

4. **Baggage Rules Vary by Journey Type**: Domestic vs international, codeshare vs direct, and mixed-cabin itineraries all follow different rules.

5. **Progressive Disclosure is Critical**: Users need concise comparisons upfront with ability to drill down into details without overwhelming the initial view.

### Most Important Insight

**The industry is moving from standardized fare classes to dynamic, personalized pricing** powered by NDC (New Distribution Capability). By 2025, traditional fare buckets are giving way to AI-driven offers tailored to individual travelers. This means our implementation must be flexible enough to accommodate both current fare structures AND future personalized bundles.

### 5. BUDGET CARRIERS

#### Spirit Airlines

**Philosophy:** Ultra-low base fare + unbundled everything

| Item | Policy | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| Personal item | Included (max 9x15x18") | Free |
| Carry-on bag | Not included on "Go" fare | $15-77 (varies by route/timing) |
| Checked bag (1st) | Not included | $50 online / $79 at airport |
| Checked bag (2nd) | Not included | Higher fees |
| Weight limit | Checked bags | 50 lbs (increased from 40 lbs) |
| Seat selection | Not included | $1-50 depending on seat/route |
| Changes | Not included | Not allowed on cheapest fares |

#### Frontier Airlines

**Philosophy:** Similar to Spirit with reverse pricing on bags

| Item | Policy | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| Personal item | Included (must fit under seat) | Free |
| Carry-on bag | Not included | MORE expensive than checked (unusual) |
| Checked bag | Not included | Cheaper than carry-on |
| Weight limit | Checked bags | 40 lbs (stricter than Spirit) |
| Pricing strategy | Dynamic | Cheapest at booking, most expensive at gate |

**Key Insight:** Budget carriers collected the 3rd-highest baggage fees despite having lowest base fares. After adding bags, they're often NOT the cheapest option.

## BAGGAGE RULES ENCYCLOPEDIA

### DOMESTIC US FLIGHTS

#### Standard Allowances (Major Carriers)

**Carry-On:**
- **Size:** 22" x 14" x 9" (56 x 36 x 23 cm) - industry standard
- **Personal Item:** 18" x 14" x 8" (45 x 35 x 20 cm)
- **Weight:** Generally not enforced on US domestic; when specified, ~40 lbs
- **Quantity:** 1 carry-on + 1 personal item (except Basic Economy varies by airline)

**Checked Baggage:**
- **Size Limit:** 62 linear inches (length + width + height)
  - Example: 28" + 20" + 14" = 62"
  - Industry standard across all major carriers
- **Weight Limit - Economy:** 50 lbs (23 kg)
- **Weight Limit - Premium/Business/First:** 70 lbs (32 kg)
- **Overweight Fee:** $100 for bags 51-70 lbs (domestic)
- **Oversized Fee:** $200+ for bags over 62 linear inches

#### Fees (2025)

**United/American/Delta:**
- 1st checked bag: $35 online / $40 at airport
- 2nd checked bag: $45
- 3rd+ checked bags: $150+

**Budget Carriers (Spirit/Frontier):**
- See fare taxonomy above - fees vary dramatically by timing and route
- Paying at gate can cost 2-3x more than prepaying online

### INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS

#### IATA Standards (Advisory, Not Mandatory)

**Two Concepts:**

1. **Piece Concept** (North America, Caribbean, parts of South America)
   - Passengers allowed specific NUMBER of bags
   - Economy: 1-2 pieces at 23 kg (50 lbs) each
   - Business/First: 2-3 pieces at 32 kg (70 lbs) each

2. **Weight Concept** (Rest of world)
   - Passengers allowed total WEIGHT regardless of pieces
   - Economy: 20-30 kg total
   - Business/First: 30-40 kg total

**Important:** IATA sets standards but airlines set their own rules. Always check specific carrier.

#### Regional Variations

**Trans-Atlantic (US-Europe):**
- Generally piece concept
- Economy: 1 checked bag (23 kg)
- Premium Economy: 2 checked bags (23 kg)
- Business: 2 checked bags (32 kg)

**Trans-Pacific (US-Asia):**
- Generally piece concept
- More generous allowances (often 2 bags in economy)
- Higher weight limits

**Middle East/Africa:**
- Often weight concept
- Can vary significantly by carrier

### SIZE & WEIGHT STANDARDS EXPLAINED

#### Linear Inches

**What it is:** Sum of length + width + height
**Why airlines use it:** Simpler than volume, allows shape flexibility
**How to measure:** Exterior dimensions including wheels and handles

**Example:**
- Bag measures: 26" long x 18" wide x 18" high
- Linear inches: 26 + 18 + 18 = 62 inches ✓ (at limit)

**Common Sizes:**
- 21" carry-on = ~45 linear inches
- 24" medium = ~54 linear inches
- 28" large = ~62 linear inches (standard max)
- 32" extra-large = ~70 linear inches (oversized fee)

#### Kilograms vs Pounds

**International Standard:** Kilograms (kg)
**US Domestic:** Pounds (lbs)

**Key Conversions:**
- 23 kg = 50 lbs (economy international standard)
- 32 kg = 70 lbs (business/first international standard)
- 20 kg = 44 lbs (some budget carriers)

**Airport Scale Variance:** Scales can vary by 1-2 lbs. If close to limit, leave buffer.

### SPECIAL BAGGAGE CATEGORIES

#### Medical Devices

**Policy:** Do NOT count toward baggage allowance
**Allowed Items:**
- CPAP machines
- Portable oxygen concentrators
- Wheelchairs/walkers
- Crutches
- Insulin pumps and supplies
- Breast pumps
- Glucose monitors

**TSA Rules:**
- Generally allowed in carry-on (preferred)
- Checked baggage not recommended for critical devices
- 48 hours advance notice recommended

**Carrier Requirements:**
- American Airlines: Medical devices don't count as carry-on or personal item
- United: Same policy
- Documentation may be required for some devices

#### Infant Items

**Standard Allowance (in addition to adult baggage):**
- 1 stroller (fully collapsible, gate-checked free)
- 1 car seat OR booster seat OR travel cot
- Diaper bags (usually don't count as personal item)

**For Lap Infants (under 2):**
- Free to hold infant (no seat required)
- Can bring FAA-approved harness
- Infant formula/breast milk exempt from liquid restrictions

#### Sports Equipment

**Generally:** Counts as 1 checked bag, fees may apply

**Common Items & Policies:**
- **Golf clubs:** Standard checked bag fee
- **Skis/snowboards:** Often $30-50 fee
- **Bicycles:** $50-150 fee, must be boxed
- **Surfboards:** $150+ fee, size restrictions
- **Fishing rods:** Often allowed as carry-on if under 62"

**Airlines vary significantly** - always check specific carrier policy.

## PER-SEGMENT BAGGAGE LOGIC

### When Do Rules Differ By Segment?

This is one of the MOST confusing aspects for customers. The rules depend on:
1. Domestic vs international routing
2. Single ticket vs separate tickets
3. Codeshare vs direct service
4. Mixed cabin classes
5. Operating vs marketing carrier

### IATA Resolution 302 (Most Significant Carrier)

**Effective:** April 1, 2011 (updated April 1, 2015)

**Original Rule (2011-2015):**
The "Most Significant Carrier" (MSC) determined baggage policy for entire journey:
- For travel between IATA areas: carrier on first sector crossing areas
- MSC's baggage rules applied to entire ticket

**Current Rule (2015-present):**
MSC logic NO LONGER applies in most cases. Instead:
- **First marketing carrier's baggage rules apply for entire journey**
- Exception: US DOT regulations override for US domestic portions

### Codeshare Flights

**Definition:**
- **Marketing Carrier:** Airline whose code is on ticket (who you bought from)
- **Operating Carrier:** Airline actually flying the plane

**Example:**
- Ticket: "United 1234 operated by Lufthansa"
- Marketing: United (UA)
- Operating: Lufthansa (LH)

**Baggage Rules on Codeshares:**

| Baggage Type | Which Carrier's Rules Apply |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| **Checked Baggage Allowance** | Marketing carrier (first segment) |
| **Checked Baggage Fees** | Marketing carrier (first segment) |
| **Carry-On Allowance** | Operating carrier (always) |
| **Elite Status Benefits** | Operating carrier of first segment that day |

**Critical Insight:** You might book United but fly Lufthansa. You get:
- United's checked bag allowance and fees
- Lufthansa's carry-on rules
- Confusion at airport if rules differ

### Mixed Cabin Itineraries

**Scenario:** Business class outbound, Economy return (or vice versa)

**General Practice - Most Generous Allowance:**
For itineraries touching the United States, airlines typically apply the most generous allowance from any leg for the entire journey.

**Example:**
- Outbound: Business (2 bags at 70 lbs)
- Return: Economy (1 bag at 50 lbs)
- **You get:** 2 bags at 70 lbs for entire round trip

**Exceptions:**
- British Airways: Applies most generous allowance globally
- Some carriers: Apply per-segment rules strictly
- Budget carriers on one leg: May enforce their strict limits
- Singapore Airlines: Check e-ticket for mixed-cabin allowances

**Best Practice:** Always verify with airline for specific booking. Policies vary significantly.

### Multi-Airline Itineraries

**Single Ticket with Multiple Airlines:**

**Example:** Book one ticket ORD-JFK-LHR (United to JFK, British Airways to LHR)
- First marketing carrier's rules apply (United)
- US DOT requires this for tickets issued in US

**Separate Tickets:**
- Each ticket's rules apply independently
- NO through-checking of bags in most cases
- Must collect and re-check bags between tickets
- Higher risk if first flight delays

### International Baggage on Domestic Segments

**Key Rule:** If your ticket includes international travel, international baggage allowances apply to domestic segments on the same ticket.

**Example:**
- Ticket: LAX-DFW-London (all on American Airlines)
- LAX-DFW is domestic BUT gets international allowances
- Because ticket includes transatlantic segment

**Stopover vs Connection:**
- **Connection** (under 24 hours): International rules apply throughout
- **Stopover** (over 24 hours): May be treated as separate journeys

---

## REGULATORY LANDSCAPE

### US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (DOT) REQUIREMENTS

#### Full Fare Advertising Rule (2012)

**Regulation:** 14 CFR § 399.84

**Core Requirement:**
All advertised air fares must state the **entire price** to be paid by consumers, including:
- Base fare
- All government-imposed taxes and fees
- All mandatory carrier-imposed surcharges
- Fuel surcharges
- September 11th security fees
- Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs)
- Any other mandatory fees

**Effective:** January 26, 2012

**Display Requirements:**
- Total price must be displayed first time fare is shown
- Total must be most prominent (larger font than breakdown)
- Can show price breakdown but must be per passenger and less prominent
- Cannot advertise "discount off base fare" if base fare excludes mandatory fees

**Violations & Enforcement:**
- DOT Aviation Consumer Protection division enforces
- Civil penalties issued for violations
- Travelocity, LAN Airlines, and others have been fined

**What This Means:**
The "$99 flight" you see MUST be the actual total price including taxes/fees. This is the price customer pays at checkout.

#### Ancillary Fee Disclosure Rule (2024-2026)

**Final Rule Announced:** April 2024
**Challenged in Court:** January 28, 2025 - returned to DOT for revision

**Original Requirements:**
1. **Upfront Fee Disclosure** - Airlines/ticket agents must disclose fees for:
   - First checked bag
   - Second checked bag
   - Carry-on bag
   - Change/cancellation fees

2. **Passenger-Specific Pricing** - Option to see fees based on:
   - Frequent flyer status
   - Military status
   - Credit card held
   - OR remain anonymous and see standard fees

3. **Timeline:**
   - Airlines: Share data with ticket agents by Oct 30, 2024
   - Airlines: Meet disclosure requirements by April 30, 2025
   - Large ticket agents: Comply by Oct 30, 2025
   - Small ticket agents: Comply by April 30, 2026

**Current Status:** Under revision due to court ruling about study methodology

**Expected Impact:** Would save consumers $500+ million annually by preventing surprise fees

#### What Airlines MUST Disclose

**Before Purchase:**
✓ Total fare (all mandatory charges)
✓ Baggage fee information (when rule takes full effect)
✓ Change/cancellation policies
✓ Delay/cancellation compensation policies

**NOT Required:**
✗ Fare class details (Basic vs Economy)
✗ Amenity comparisons
✗ Seat selection fees
✗ Upgrade fees
✗ Wi-Fi or meal costs

**Key Insight:** DOT requires transparency on PRICES and FEES but not on what's INCLUDED in different fare types. This is why branded fares are confusing.

### Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) - Digital Accessibility

**Requirements:** Airline websites must comply with WCAG 2.0 Level AA

**Who Must Comply:**
- US and foreign carriers operating 60+ seat aircraft
- Marketing to US consumers
- Applies to primary website

**Effective Dates:**
- Core booking functions: June 30, 2016 (WCAG Level A & AA)
- Full compliance: December 12, 2015 (all public pages)

**Core Functions Covered:**
- Searching flights
- Booking or changing reservations
- Selecting seats
- Managing all flight amenities

**Key Requirements:**
- Must work with screen readers
- Keyboard navigation required
- Proper color contrast
- Alternative text for images
- User testing with people with disabilities REQUIRED
- Cannot create separate "accessible website" - main site must be accessible

**Penalties:**
- $27,500 per violation
- DOT enforces actively

**Implications for Fare Display:**
- Must be readable by screen readers
- Tables must have proper headers
- Interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Color cannot be only indicator (must have text/icons too)

### Consumer Protection Rules

**Tarmac Delay Rules:**
- 3 hours domestic / 4 hours international max
- Not directly related to fare display but affects customer trust

**Denied Boarding Compensation:**
- Required compensation for involuntary bumping
- Must be clearly disclosed

**Refund Requirements (New 2024 Rule):**
- Automatic refunds for cancelled/significantly delayed flights
- Clear refund policies must be disclosed

**Implications:** High regulatory scrutiny on transparency. Best practice is to EXCEED minimum requirements to build trust.

---

## BEST PRACTICES FOR DISPLAY

### What Causes MOST Customer Confusion

Based on complaint data and travel forums, the top confusion areas are:

1. **Basic Economy Restrictions (70% of confusion)**
   - "I didn't know I couldn't bring a carry-on"
   - "Why can't I sit with my family?"
   - "I can't change my ticket at all?"
   - Airlines vary (Delta allows carry-on, United doesn't)

2. **Baggage Fees & Allowances (16% of complaints to DOT)**
   - "Which airline's baggage rules apply?"
   - "Do I get baggage on my codeshare?"
   - "Why is outbound different from return?"
   - Mixed cabin/carrier itineraries most confusing

3. **Seat Selection Fees**
   - When is it free vs paid?
   - Main Cabin Extra vs Economy Plus vs Premium Economy vs Premium Select
   - Terminology varies by airline

4. **Change/Cancel Policies**
   - Basic Economy: never allowed
   - Main Cabin: fee applies
   - Premium: free changes
   - Credit vs refund vs nothing

5. **What's Actually Included**
   - "Does my fare include a meal?"
   - "Do I get Wi-Fi?"
   - "Are drinks free?"
   - Varies by carrier, route, cabin

### How Airlines Explain Fare Structures

#### United's Approach

**Comparison Chart:** united.com/en-us/seat-options
- Side-by-side table of all fare types
- Checkmarks/X marks for included/excluded items
- Progressive disclosure: brief overview → full details
- Visual hierarchy: Basic → Economy → Plus → Premium → Business

**Strengths:**
- Clear visual comparison
- Easy to scan
- All options presented equally

**Weaknesses:**
- Information overload for simple bookings
- Doesn't emphasize recommended option
- Mobile experience can be cramped

#### American's Approach

**Branded Fare Cards:**
- Card-based layout for each fare type
- Color-coded (Basic = gray, Main = blue, Premium = purple)
- "What's included" listed on each card
- Upsell messaging ("Upgrade to Main for only $30")

**Strengths:**
- Emphasizes differences between tiers
- Good for upselling
- Clear value proposition

**Weaknesses:**
- Can feel sales-y
- Harder to compare across all options
- Basic Economy hidden unless expanded

#### Delta's Approach

**Experience Selector:**
- New branding: Basic/Classic/Extra
- Shows as radio button selection
- Dynamically updates price
- "Most Popular" badge on recommended option

**Strengths:**
- Simplified decision (3 choices not 6)
- Reduces cognitive load
- Gentle nudge to middle option

**Weaknesses:**
- May hide important details
- Product vs Experience split could confuse
- Less transparent about what you're losing

### Progressive Disclosure Strategy

**Principle:** Show essential info first, details on demand

**Level 1 - Initial View (Required Info):**
```
Flight: UA 1234 | ORD-SFO | 10:00 AM - 12:30 PM

Economy  $299
Premium  $449  [Most Flexible]
Business $899
```

**Level 2 - On Hover/Tap (Key Differentiators):**
```
Economy
- 1 carry-on bag
- Seat selection: Free
- Changes: $75 fee
- MileagePlus: 5x miles

[Compare all fares →]
```

**Level 3 - Comparison View (Full Details):**
```
Side-by-side table with all fare classes
All included/excluded items
Per-segment details if applicable
Link to airline's official policy
```

**Benefits:**
- Doesn't overwhelm on first view
- Lets users drill down if needed
- Mobile-friendly (less scrolling)
- Reduces decision paralysis

### Trust-Building Techniques

#### 1. Transparency Over Persuasion

**Bad:**
```
"Basic Economy - SAVE BIG! Just $199!"
*no carry-on, no seat selection, no changes
```

**Good:**
```
"Basic Economy - $199
Personal item only (no carry-on)
Seat assigned at check-in
No changes or cancellations
[See what's included →]"
```

#### 2. Proactive Warnings

**Critical for Basic Economy:**
Show warnings BEFORE user selects fare:
- "⚠️ This fare does not include carry-on baggage"
- "⚠️ You cannot sit with companions unless you purchase seats"
- "⚠️ This ticket cannot be changed or cancelled"

**Research shows:** Users feel deceived when restrictions appear AFTER selection, even if technically disclosed.

#### 3. Show, Don't Hide

**Bad Practice:**
- Restrictions in fine print
- Require clicking multiple times to see baggage rules
- Different terminology than airline uses

**Good Practice:**
- Icons for included items ✓
- Grayed-out or ✗ for excluded items
- Consistent terminology with airline
- Baggage rules shown inline

#### 4. Explain Complex Rules Simply

**Codeshare Example:**

**Complex (Accurate but Confusing):**
"Baggage allowance determined by IATA Resolution 302 Most Significant Carrier rule as amended April 1, 2015, whereby first marketing carrier's published tariff applies subject to US DOT override for domestic portions..."

**Simple (User-Friendly):**
"Your baggage allowance: 2 bags (50 lbs each)
Based on United's policy (first flight on your ticket)"

#### 5. Per-Segment Clarity

**For Multi-Airline Itineraries:**

**Show:**
```
Outbound: ORD-FRA
Lufthansa Business
Baggage: 2 bags (70 lbs each)

Return: FRA-ORD
United Economy
Baggage: 2 bags (70 lbs each)
           ↑ Uses most generous allowance
```

**Don't just show:** "Baggage: Varies by segment"

### Accessibility Considerations

**Required by ACAA:**

1. **Screen Reader Compatibility**
   - All fare comparison tables need proper headers
   - Use `<table>`, `<th>`, `<caption>` properly
   - ARIA labels for interactive elements

2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Can tab through all fare options
   - Can expand/collapse details with keyboard
   - Focus states clearly visible

3. **Color + Text**
   - Don't rely on color alone (green checkmark + "Included" text)
   - Sufficient contrast ratios (4.5:1 for text)
   - Icons must have text alternatives

4. **Clear Language**
   - Avoid jargon
   - Explain abbreviations on first use
   - Short sentences and paragraphs

5. **User Testing**
   - Legally required to test with people with disabilities
   - Not just automated tools

### Display Templates

### Mobile Considerations

**Key Challenges:**
- Limited screen space
- Harder to compare side-by-side
- More scrolling required

**Solutions:**
1. **Accordion/Expandable Sections**
   - Show fare price + 2-3 key features
   - Tap to expand full details
   - Collapse others when one expands

2. **Horizontal Swipe for Comparison**
   - Swipe left/right through fare types
   - Like Instagram stories
   - Price stays fixed at top

3. **Sticky CTA**
   - "Select" button always visible
   - Doesn't require scrolling back up

4. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Desktop: Full comparison table
   - Mobile: Stacked cards with compare mode

## INDUSTRY TRENDS

### Evolution of Basic Economy (2006-2025)

#### 2006: Spirit Pioneers Unbundling
- Spirit introduces "bare bones" fares
- Charges for everything: carry-on, seat, water
- Rest of industry watches skeptically

#### 2012: Delta Experiments
- Delta introduces Basic Economy on Spirit-competing routes only
- Tests customer acceptance
- Revenue results positive

#### 2016-2017: Big 3 Go All-In
- United, American, Delta roll out Basic Economy system-wide
- Goal: Compete with ULCCs while preserving premium revenue
- Differentiate from main cabin to justify higher fares

#### 2018-2020: Refinements
- Airlines tweak restrictions (e.g., United adds trans-Atlantic exception)
- Complaints surge about confusion
- OTAs slow to clearly display restrictions

#### 2021-2023: Post-Pandemic Shifts
- Premium demand surges
- Airlines add more premium seats
- Basic Economy becomes smaller portion of inventory
- Focus shifts to upselling

#### 2024-2025: Regulatory Scrutiny
- Senate report: Airlines make billions on "junk fees"
- DOT proposes stricter disclosure rules
- Some backlash, but Basic Economy here to stay
- JetBlue latest to add Basic Economy (Sept 2024)

### Unbundling vs Rebundling

**Unbundling Trend (2006-2020):**
- Separate everything: bags, seats, snacks, Wi-Fi
- Maximize ancillary revenue
- "A la carte" model
- Each item priced individually

**Rebundling Trend (2020-2025):**
- Create "bundles" of popular combinations
- Premium Economy growth (seat + bags + flexibility)
- Branded fares (Basic/Classic/Extra)
- Simplify decision but maintain revenue

**The Pendulum:**
```
Fully Bundled → Unbundled Everything → Strategic Rebundling → Personalized Bundles
(Pre-2000)      (2006-2015)            (2015-2020)           (2020-2025+)
```

**Why Rebundling?**
1. Customer confusion with too many choices
2. Operational complexity
3. Bad PR ("nickel and diming")
4. Revenue optimization (bundles increase total spend)
5. NDC enables dynamic bundles vs static a la carte

### Future: Dynamic Personalization (2025+)

**NDC (New Distribution Capability):**
- IATA standard for direct airline distribution
- Bypasses traditional GDS limitations
- Enables real-time, personalized offers

**What This Enables:**

1. **Dynamic Bundles**
   - Not fixed "Economy vs Premium"
   - AI-generated offers based on:
     - Your search history
     - Your loyalty status
     - Current inventory
     - Route/time of day
     - Your past purchases

2. **Continuous Pricing**
   - Prices update in real-time
   - Not fixed fare buckets
   - Like Uber surge pricing
   - Maximizes revenue per seat

3. **Hyper-Personalization**
   - "Business travelers on this route usually add lounge access"
   - "Families prefer seats together + priority boarding"
   - "You usually upgrade to extra legroom"
   - Offer exactly what user wants

**76 airlines using NDC as of 2025**, with rapid acceleration

**Implications for OTAs:**
- Must integrate with NDC APIs
- Can't scrape/cache prices (change too fast)
- Need to display dynamic offers
- Harder to compare across airlines (less standardization)

### 2025 Predictions from Industry

**From PROS.com (Airline Revenue Management):**
1. AI-driven insights will streamline revenue management
2. Shift from "revenue management" to "economics mindset"
3. Focus on price elasticity over historical buckets
4. Dynamic offer construction becomes standard
5. Continuous pricing replaces overnight batch updates

**From Travel Industry:**
1. Premium cabins continue growing faster than economy
2. "New Main Cabin" will be better than old (to upsell from Basic)
3. Basic Economy becomes even more basic (maintain differentiation)
4. Sustainability fees may be introduced
5. More airline-direct bookings (NDC surcharges on GDS)

**What This Means for Fly2Any:**

Our implementation must:
- Support both current fare structure AND dynamic offers
- Don't hardcode fare class names (they'll change)
- Build flexible comparison tools (number of options may vary)
- Prepare for personalized pricing (same flight, different prices)
- Focus on transparency even as complexity increases

## CRITICAL QUESTIONS ANSWERED

### 1. What Causes the MOST Customer Confusion?

**Answer:** Basic Economy restrictions, specifically:
- Not understanding "no carry-on" policies (esp. on United domestic)
- Seat assignment at check-in (families can't sit together)
- No changes/cancellations (even with fees)
- Variability between airlines (Delta allows carry-on, United doesn't)

**Root Cause:** OTAs and airlines don't warn clearly BEFORE selection. Restrictions shown in fine print or during checkout, when user already emotionally committed.

**Solution:** Prominent warnings at point of selection, not point of purchase.

### 2. How Do Airlines Themselves Explain Fare Structures?

**Answer:** Three main approaches:

1. **Comparison Tables** (United) - Side-by-side grid, all features
2. **Fare Cards** (American) - Individual cards with upsell messaging
3. **Simplified Tiers** (Delta) - Basic/Classic/Extra with progressive disclosure

**Common Elements:**
- Visual indicators (checkmarks/X's)
- Price prominently displayed
- Key differentiators highlighted
- Link to full policy details
- "Most Popular" or "Best Value" nudges

**Trend:** Moving from feature lists to benefit-focused messaging
- Not just "1 checked bag" but "Never pay baggage fees"
- Not just "Changes allowed" but "Stay flexible"

### 3. What Are Common Customer Complaints?

**Answer:** From DOT complaint data and travel forums:

**Top 3 (74% of complaints):**
1. **Refunds** (delays in processing, denied refunds)
2. **Cancellations/Delays** (lack of compensation, poor communication)
3. **Baggage** (16% of complaints - lost, damaged, fee disputes)

**Fare Transparency Specific:**
- Unexpected fees (bags, seats, changes)
- Misleading advertising (base fare vs total)
- Complex/hidden policies
- Inability to cancel Basic Economy

**Emotional Drivers:**
- Feeling deceived ("I didn't know...")
- Powerlessness (can't fix mistake)
- Unfair treatment (elite on competing airline not recognized)

**Trust Factor:** Once trust is broken, customer never books with that source again.

### 4. What Information is Legally Required vs Optional?

**Legally Required (US DOT):**
✓ Total fare including all mandatory fees (first display)
✓ Baggage fees (when final rule takes effect)
✓ Change/cancel fees (when final rule takes effect)
✓ Refund policies
✓ Tarmac delay policies
✓ Accessibility (WCAG 2.0 AA compliance)

**Not Required but Best Practice:**
- Fare class comparison (Basic vs Economy)
- What's included in each fare
- Per-segment baggage details
- Codeshare clarifications
- Mixed cabin allowances
- Elite status benefits

**Key Insight:** Legal minimum is LOW. Competitive advantage comes from exceeding it.

### 5. How Do International vs Domestic Rules Differ?

**Answer:** Major differences:

| Aspect | Domestic US | International |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Baggage Concept** | Piece (number of bags) | Piece or Weight (varies by region) |
| **Carry-on Weight** | Usually not enforced | Often strictly enforced |
| **Checked Weight** | 50 lbs economy | 23 kg (50 lbs) or 20 kg (44 lbs) |
| **Allowance** | Usually 1 bag | Often 1-2 bags depending on route |
| **Fees** | $35-40 first bag | Often 1 bag free, fees for 2nd |
| **Elite Benefits** | More generous | Depends on alliance, not just carrier |
| **Stopover Rules** | N/A | Under 24h = connection, over = separate |

**Special Case:** Domestic segment on international ticket gets international allowances

### 6. What Happens When Outbound/Return Have Different Rules?

**Answer:** Depends on ticket structure:

**Single Ticket (Most Common):**
- First marketing carrier's rules apply to ENTIRE journey
- Exception: US DOT rules override for US portions
- **Best Practice:** Usually most generous allowance is applied

**Mixed Cabin on Single Ticket:**
- Business outbound + Economy return = Business allowance for full trip
- US carriers and British Airways confirmed to use this policy
- Singapore Airlines: Check e-ticket (varies)

**Separate Tickets:**
- Each ticket's rules apply independently
- MUST collect and re-check bags
- No through-check in most cases
- Riskier if first flight delays

**Codeshare Complications:**
- Marketing carrier's checked bag policy
- Operating carrier's carry-on policy
- Can differ on outbound vs return if different operators

**Critical for Display:** Must show per-segment AND total trip allowance clearly
