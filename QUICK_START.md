- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check console for error messages

### Email Not Sending?

- With `RESEND_API_KEY`: Check API key is valid
- Verify `FROM_EMAIL` domain is verified (or use `onboarding@resend.dev`)

### Admin Page Not Loading?
- Clear browser cache
- Check for JavaScript errors in console
- Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

### Payment Confirmation Not Working?
- Ensure booking status is "pending"
- Check booking ID in URL is correct
- Verify database connection
