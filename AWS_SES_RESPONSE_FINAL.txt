Hello AWS Support Team,

Thank you for reviewing our request. Below is detailed information about our email-sending practices for Fly2Any (www.fly2any.com).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. VERIFIED DOMAIN STATUS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Domain: fly2any.com
Region: us-east-2
Status: VERIFIED (November 2, 2025)
Authentication: SPF, DKIM (3 CNAME records), DMARC, Custom MAIL FROM (mail.fly2any.com)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
2. EMAIL SENDING FREQUENCY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Current Volume:
- Daily: 50-200 emails
- Monthly: 1,500-6,000 emails
- Peak hours: 9 AM - 11 PM EST
- 7 days/week (travel bookings happen on weekends)

Email Breakdown:
- Booking Confirmations: 60% (immediate after purchase)
- Payment Receipts: 30% (2 minutes after payment)
- Security Notifications: 10% (password resets, account changes)

6-Month Projection:
- Daily: 300-800 emails

- Seasonal peaks (holidays): 2-3x normal volume

12-Month Projection:

- Business expansion: hotel bookings, car rentals

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
3. RECIPIENT LIST MANAGEMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Acquisition (100% Opt-In):
1. Customer creates account on fly2any.com (voluntary registration)
2. Email verified via confirmation link
3. Customer completes flight booking (confirmed purchase transaction)
4. Email associated with booking_id in database
5. Clear notice during checkout: "You'll receive booking confirmation at [email]"

We DO NOT:
- Purchase or rent email lists
- Scrape email addresses
- Send to anyone who hasn't completed a booking
- Share emails with third parties

Database Management:
- Emails stored in Neon PostgreSQL (encrypted at rest)
- Tagged with status: active/bounced/complained/unsubscribed
- 90-day retention for inactive accounts (GDPR compliance)

List Hygiene:
- Daily: Process bounces/complaints, remove invalid emails
- Weekly: Review soft bounce patterns, verify flagged accounts
- Monthly: Audit list quality, remove disposable email domains

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
4. BOUNCE HANDLING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Hard Bounces (Permanent Failures):
- AWS SES webhook to /api/webhooks/ses-bounce
- Immediate actions:
  * Set email_status = 'bounced' in database
  * Add to suppression list (never send again)
  * In-app notification: "Email delivery failed. Please update your email."
  * Support ticket auto-created
- Target: <1% hard bounce rate

Soft Bounces (Temporary Failures):
- Retry logic: 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours
- After 3 failures: Treat as hard bounce
- Track rolling 7-day window: 3+ soft bounces = flag account

Monitoring:
- Target bounce rate: <2% (AWS requires <5%)
- Alert at >5%: Auto-pause sending + investigation
- Weekly bounce reports with root cause analysis

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
5. COMPLAINT HANDLING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Real-Time Processing:
- AWS SES feedback loop to /api/webhooks/ses-complaint
- Immediate actions:
  * Set email_status = 'complained'
  * Add to permanent suppression list
  * Remove from ALL email lists
  * Auto-create high-priority support ticket
- Support team response within 4 hours
- Root cause analysis: Review email content, validate booking legitimacy

Monitoring:
- Target complaint rate: <0.1% (AWS requires <0.5%)
- Alert at >0.3%: Immediate team meeting
- Weekly complaint reports with action plans

Prevention:
- Clear sender identification: "Fly2Any Bookings <bookings@fly2any.com>"
- Relevant content only (booking-related)
- Visible unsubscribe link in footer
- Plain text alternative for every HTML email

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
6. UNSUBSCRIBE MANAGEMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Email Types:
- Booking Confirmations: Cannot unsubscribe (legally required)
- Payment Receipts: Cannot unsubscribe (financial record)
- Security Alerts: Cannot unsubscribe (account protection)
- Pre-flight Reminders: Can unsubscribe (optional convenience)

Unsubscribe Methods:
1. One-click link in email footer (instant processing)
2. Account settings toggle (fly2any.com/settings)
3. Reply with "UNSUBSCRIBE" (processed within 24 hours)

Processing:
- Database updated <1 second
- Synced with AWS SES suppression list within 10 minutes
- Permanent preference (never expires unless customer re-opts-in)
- Target unsubscribe rate: <0.5%

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
7. EMAIL CONTENT EXAMPLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Example 1: Booking Confirmation (60% volume)
Subject: Flight Booking Confirmed - NYC to London
Content: Booking reference, flight details (airline, times, route, seat), payment summary ($555.50 total), next steps (check-in link, passport reminder, airport arrival time), support contact. Footer includes physical address (123 Main St, NY 10001), unsubscribe link, privacy policy.
