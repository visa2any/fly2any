### 4.2 "Aha Moment" for Fare Differences

**When Users Understand Fare Tiers:**

1. **First Awareness: Basic Economy Filter (Search Phase)**
   - Dropdown shows "include Basic" vs "exclude Basic"
   - Users see price jump when excluding Basic
   - Example: $402 (Basic) → $619 (Main Classic)

2. **Second Awareness: Baggage Icons (Results Phase)**
   - Icons immediately show what's included
   - Missing carry-on icon = red flag for budget carriers

3. **Full Understanding: Booking Options Panel (Selection Phase)**
   - Side-by-side fare comparison
   - Clear "What's included" bullets
   - Price difference explicitly shown
   - **This is THE aha moment**

**Example Booking Options Panel Layout:**
```
┌────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┐
│ Basic Economy  │ Main Cabin     │ Premium Eco    │
│ $250           │ $320           │ $450           │
├────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┤

     [Select]         [Select]         [Select]
                      (Cheapest)
```

### 4.3 Third-Party Booking Redirect Flow

**How Google Handles the Handoff:**

1. **Pre-Redirect Transparency**
   - Shows all booking options with partners listed
   - "Book with United" vs "Book with Expedia" vs "Book with Priceline"
   - Same flight, different OTAs, different prices shown

2. **"Book on Google" Feature** (Select Flights)
   - Complete booking within Google interface
   - Payment processed by airline/OTA on backend
   - Message: "You are booking with [Airline]. Google will transfer your data to them."

3. **Standard Redirect**
   - Click "Select" → New tab opens to partner site
   - Flight details pre-populated
   - Users complete passenger info and payment

**User Pain Points Identified in Research:**
- **Trust issues with OTAs**: Users cross-reference prices with airline direct site

- **Frustration**: Extra step to verify pricing authenticity

**Google's Mitigation:**

- Displays multiple partners for price comparison

### 4.4 Fare Upgrade Presentation

**When Shown:**

**DON'T:**

4. ❌ Bury baggage info in fine print (Google surfaces it early)
5. ❌ Make Basic Economy the default without clear opt-out
6. ❌ Show prices without taxes (2025 standard is all-in)
7. ❌ Overwhelm with too many filters visible at once
8. ❌ Use jargon (Google: "No overhead bin" not "Restricted cabin baggage")

**DO:**
1. ✅ Prioritize speed (sub-60-second flow)
2. ✅ Use progressive disclosure
3. ✅ Show fare comparison side-by-side
4. ✅ Include baggage icons inline with price
5. ✅ Offer Basic Economy filter/toggle
6. ✅ Link to full airline policies
7. ✅ Be transparent about data sources

- Users can toggle to "Exclude Basic Economy" filter
- Typical price increase: ~$200 when excluding Basic

### 10.2 International Route (NYC → London)

**User Flow:**
1. More complex results with multi-carrier options
2. Baggage icons MAY NOT appear (inconsistent)
3. Must expand to see detailed baggage policies
4. Fare classes vary: Economy Basic, Economy, Premium Economy, Business
5. Booking options show multiple OTAs + airline direct

**Key Observations:**
- International = less baggage info upfront
- More reliance on expanded details
- Overnight layover warnings prominent
- Price range wider ($400-$1500+)

### 10.3 Ultra-Low-Cost Carrier (Spirit/Frontier)

**User Flow:**
1. Spirit appears in "Cheapest" tab
2. Price significantly lower than legacy carriers
3. Baggage icons show NO carry-on included
4. Warning banner: "Fees apply for bags, seat selection, carry-on"
5. Booking options link to Spirit's fee page

**Key Observations:**
- Warnings very prominent (hard to miss)
- Using "Carry-on included" filter removes Spirit entirely
- Users can compare Spirit base + bag fees vs legacy carrier
- Transparency prevents surprise fees

### 10.4 Multi-City Itinerary

**User Flow:**
1. Can add up to 5 segments
2. Each segment priced separately
3. Baggage policies shown per-segment
4. No aggregate summary (user must mentally calculate)
5. Warning if separate tickets required

**Key Observations:**

- No "total baggage allowance" summary
- Users must track each segment independently
- Opportunity for Fly2Any to improve here

## 11. CRITICAL FOCUS AREAS: ANSWERS TO KEY QUESTIONS

### Q1: How do they handle MIXED baggage (outbound has bag, return doesn't)?

**Answer:**
- They DON'T provide a visual alert or summary
- Users must expand flight details
- Each segment lists baggage separately under "Outbound" and "Return" headings
- No aggregate "worst case" warning
- **This is a GAP and an OPPORTUNITY for Fly2Any**

**Recommendation:**
Add a badge: "⚠️ Different baggage policies" with tooltip: "Outbound includes 1 checked bag, return does not. Total: $40 for return bag."

---

### Q2: Where is the "aha moment" where users understand fare differences?

**Answer:**
The **Booking Options Panel** on the trip summary page.

**Why it works:**
1. **Side-by-side comparison**: Basic | Main | Premium in columns
2. **Clear price differences**: Shows +$70, +$200, etc.
3. **"What's included" bullets**: Visual checkmarks and X marks
4. **Inline, not modal**: No popup interruption
5. **User control**: Can switch fares without re-searching

**Example Layout:**
```
Your trip: JFK → LAX → JFK
Total: $500 (2 passengers)

Booking Options:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Basic Economy    Main Cabin      Premium Eco   │
│ $250             $320            $450            │
│                                                  │
│ ✗ Carry-on       ✓ Carry-on      ✓ Carry-on    │
│ ✗ Checked bag    ✗ Checked bag   ✓ Checked bag  │
│ ✗ Seat select    ✓ Seat select   ✓ Seat + extra │
│ ✗ Changes        $ Change fee     ✓ Free change  │
│                                                  │
│ [Select]         [Select]         [Select]       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Q3: What warnings or alerts do they show?

**Answer:**
1. **Basic Economy warnings** (before booking link)
2. **Short connection times** (orange icon + text)
3. **Airport change required** (for same-city transfers)
4. **Separate tickets warning** (for multi-carrier bookings)
5. **ULCC baggage restrictions** (Spirit/Frontier banner)
6. **Price fluctuation indicators** ("Low price", "High price")
7. **Overnight layover** (duration + timezone info)

**Placement Strategy:**
- Critical warnings: ABOVE booking link
- Informational warnings: Inline with flight details
- Tooltips: For explanations, not warnings

---

### Q4: How do they build trust around baggage policies?

**Answer:**
1. **Visual icons**: Instant recognition of what's included
2. **Links to airline policies**: "See [Airline] baggage policy"
3. **Estimated fees shown**: For domestic flights
4. **Filter transparency**: "Show only fares with carry-on"
5. **Warning banners**: For restrictive fares
6. **No hidden fees**: All-in pricing by default (2025)
7. **Data source disclosure**: Info icons explain price predictions

**Trust Hierarchy:**
- **Tier 1 (Highest)**: Link to official airline policy
- **Tier 2**: Estimated fees based on airline data
- **Tier 3**: Icons and labels (baggage included/not included)
- **Tier 4**: General warnings (fees may apply)
