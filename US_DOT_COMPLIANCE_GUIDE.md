## 1. FULL FARE ADVERTISING RULE (14 CFR 399.84)

### Legal Citation
**14 CFR § 399.84 - Price advertising and opt-out provisions**
Effective: January 26, 2012
Last Amended: April 30, 2024

### Exact Text of Core Requirement

> "The Department considers any advertising or solicitation by a direct air carrier, indirect air carrier, an agent of either, or a ticket agent, for passenger air transportation, a tour, or tour component that must be purchased with air transportation that states a price to be an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712, **unless the price stated is the entire price (all mandatory charges) to be paid by the customer** to the carrier, or agent, for such air transportation, tour, or tour component."

### What MUST Be Included in Displayed Prices

**MUST INCLUDE:**
- Base fare
- All mandatory carrier-imposed charges (fuel surcharges, carrier fees, etc.)
- All government-imposed taxes and fees
- Airport fees
- Security fees
- Passenger facility charges
- Customs/immigration fees
- ANY other charge that is MANDATORY to purchase the ticket

**OPTIONAL FEES (Need NOT Be Included in Advertised Price):**
- Baggage fees (checked/carry-on)
- Seat selection fees
- Priority boarding
- Lounge access
- Meals/beverages
- Wi-Fi
- Travel insurance
- Other ancillary services the customer can choose to decline

### Terminology Standards

| Term | MUST Include |
|---|---|
| "Base Fare" | All mandatory carrier-imposed charges |
| "Flight" / "Ticket" / "Fare" | All mandatory carrier-imposed charges + government charges |

**CRITICAL:** You cannot show a "base fare" that doesn't include carrier fees, then add them later. This is drip pricing and is ILLEGAL.

### Each-Way vs One-Way Fares

**PROHIBITED:**
- Advertising each-way fares (that require round-trip purchase) as "one-way" fares
- Example: "$200 one-way" when customer must buy round-trip

**ALLOWED:**
- Advertising as "$200 each way" with clear and conspicuous disclosure
- Disclosure must be "prominently and proximately" to the fare amount

### Discount Offers

Percentage-off discounts MUST:
- Make clear at the outset the terms and conditions
- Explain how the discount is calculated
- Not be misleading about the calculation method

### Examples of Compliant vs Non-Compliant Displays

#### COMPLIANT ✓
```
New York (JFK) → Los Angeles (LAX)
$350 per person
Includes all taxes and fees

[Select Flight]

Additional optional fees may apply for baggage,
seat selection, and other services.
```

#### NON-COMPLIANT ✗
```
New York (JFK) → Los Angeles (LAX)
Base Fare: $200
[Select Flight]

(Customer clicks, then sees:)
Base Fare: $200
Taxes: $100
Carrier Fee: $50
Total: $350  ← Should have shown $350 from the start
```

### Safe Harbor Practices

1. **Always show the total price first and largest**
2. **Optionally show breakdown** (base + taxes) in smaller text below
3. **Disclose optional fees separately** with clear labels
4. **Never require clicking to see mandatory charges**

---

## 2. BAGGAGE FEE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS (14 CFR 399.85)

### Legal Citation
**14 CFR § 399.85 - Notice of ancillary service fees**
Last Amended: April 30, 2024

### Current Requirements (EFFECTIVE NOW)

#### For Website/App Display (First Screen Rule)

**REQUIRED:** When showing a fare quotation for a specific itinerary:
1. Disclose "clearly and prominently" that additional airline fees for baggage may apply
2. Direct consumers to where they can see these fees
3. Must appear on "the first screen" with the fare quotation

**Example Compliant Disclosure:**
```
Flight: NYC → LAX - $350
Additional fees may apply for checked bags, carry-on bags,
and other services. [View baggage fees]
```

#### For Phone/In-Person Sales

When quoting a fare by phone or in person:
1. Disclose that baggage fees apply (if applicable)
2. Ask the consumer if they wish to hear more about specific fees

#### Airline Homepage Requirements

Airlines must prominently disclose on their homepages:
- Information about baggage fees and allowances
- Any increase in fees for carry-on or first/second checked bags
- Any change in bag allowances

### NEW RULE (Currently BLOCKED by Court - Stay Updated)

**What Would Have Been Required (Blocked as of 2024):**
- Display specific baggage fees BEFORE ticket purchase
- Fees must be shown at the first webpage where fare and schedule are provided
- Must spell out weight and dimension limitations
- Cannot require clicking a hyperlink (but pop-ups permitted)
- Would have been effective: April 30, 2025

**Status:** U.S. Court of Appeals blocked this rule due to procedural issues. The court determined DOT did not permit airlines to review and comment on a study assessing the rule's effects.

**ACTION REQUIRED:** Monitor DOT announcements for updates. The rule may be re-issued after proper procedure.

### Definitions

**"Clear and conspicuous"** means:
- Difficult to miss (easily noticeable)
- Easily understandable by consumers
- Presented in a manner that allows consumers to determine the true cost
- Enables consumers to select the best flight options

### Basic Economy Disclosures

While DOT doesn't have specific "Basic Economy" regulations, general principles apply:

**MUST DISCLOSE:**
- Non-refundability restrictions
- Baggage restrictions (no carry-on, etc.)
- No seat assignment
- No changes allowed
- Any other material restrictions

**WHEN:** Before the customer completes the purchase

**BEST PRACTICE:**
```
Basic Economy - $250
• No changes allowed
• No seat selection
• No carry-on bag included
• Non-refundable

Economy - $300
• Changes allowed (fee applies)
• Seat selection included
• Carry-on bag included
• Refundable with fee
```

---

## 5. CODE-SHARE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

### Legal Requirement
Airlines and ticket agents must disclose to consumers **before booking** if a flight is operated under a code-sharing arrangement.

### What Is Code-Sharing?
When you book a flight on Airline A, but the actual plane and crew are from Airline B.

Example: You book "United 1234" but it's actually operated by SkyWest.

### Disclosure Requirements

**MUST DISCLOSE:**
1. The corporate name of the transporting carrier (actual operator)
2. Any other name under which the flight is offered to the public

**WHEN:** Before the customer books

**WHERE (for online booking):**
> "Code-share information must be easily viewable on the **first display** of a website following a search for flights corresponding to a desired itinerary."

**Cannot:** Require clicking a link or expanding a section to see this information

### Example Compliant Display

```
United Airlines Flight 1234
New York (EWR) → Chicago (ORD)
Operated by SkyWest Airlines

$250 per person
```

### Enforcement

**DOT Has Actively Enforced This:**
- Fareportal, Inc.: $50,000 fine
- Carlson Wagonlit Travel: $125,000 fine
- Frosch International Travel: $65,000 fine
- Multiple other ticket agents fined $20,000-$45,000

**Violation:** Failing to disclose code-share arrangements on first display

### Implementation for Fly2Any

**Required Actions:**
1. Obtain operating carrier information from data sources (Amadeus, etc.)
2. Display operating carrier name on initial search results
3. Make it prominent and easily visible
4. Do not hide behind "View Details" or similar
5. Include on booking confirmation

---

## 6. ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND PRECEDENTS (2020-2025)

### DOT Enforcement Intensity

**Significant Increase:**
> "DOT issued more than $225 million in penalties against airlines for consumer protection violations since President Biden took office, compared to just over $70 million collectively issued between 1996 and 2020."

### Recent Major Enforcement Actions

#### Airlines (for reference)

**Lufthansa, KLM, South African Airways (2024):**
- Violation: Extreme delays in providing refunds (COVID-19 cancellations)

### Common Violations Leading to Enforcement

1. **Not including all taxes/fees in advertised prices**
2. **Failing to disclose code-share arrangements on first display**
3. **Advertising unavailable fares**
4. **Delayed refunds for canceled flights**
5. **Misleading customers about fare availability**

### Lessons Learned

**Best Practices to Avoid Enforcement:**
1. Always show total price (all-in) in search results
2. Code-share info visible without clicking
3. Real-time availability checking
4. Prompt refund processing
5. Accurate advertising
6. Clear and conspicuous disclosures
7. Keep detailed records of compliance efforts

---

## 7. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ANSWERED

### Q1: Can we show prices WITHOUT baggage fees, or MUST they be included?

**ANSWER: You CAN show prices without baggage fees.**

Baggage fees are considered "optional" fees and do NOT need to be included in the advertised fare price.

**HOWEVER, you MUST:**
1. Clearly disclose that baggage fees may apply
2. Direct customers to where they can see baggage fees
3. Do this on the first screen where you show the fare

**Example:**
```
✓ COMPLIANT:
NYC → LAX: $350 (includes taxes & fees)
Additional fees may apply for baggage. [View fees]

✗ NON-COMPLIANT:
NYC → LAX: $350
(Shows baggage fees only at checkout with no prior disclosure)
```

**Future Risk:** The blocked DOT rule (if re-issued) would require showing specific baggage fees upfront. Monitor DOT announcements.

---

### Q2: What exactly must be disclosed about Basic Economy before user clicks "Select"?

**ANSWER: Material restrictions must be disclosed before purchase.**

While DOT doesn't have a specific "Basic Economy Disclosure Rule," general consumer protection principles apply:

**MUST DISCLOSE (before user completes purchase):**
- Non-refundability
- Change restrictions (no changes allowed, or fees)
- Baggage restrictions (no carry-on, only personal item, etc.)
- Seat assignment restrictions (no advance seat selection)
- Boarding restrictions (boards last)
- No upgrades allowed
- Any other material restriction

**WHEN:** In the fare selection screen, clearly visible

**FORMAT:** Clear, understandable language

**Example:**
```
✓ GOOD:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Basic Economy - $250            │
│                                 │
│ Restrictions:                   │
│ • Personal item only (no carry-on)│
│ • No seat selection             │
│ • No changes or cancellations   │
│ • Boards in last group          │
│ • Non-refundable               │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Legal Standard:** A reasonable consumer should understand what they're buying and what restrictions apply BEFORE clicking the final "Book" button.

---

### Q3: Are there specific words/phrases we MUST use or MUST avoid?

**MUST USE (correct terminology per 14 CFR 399.84):**

- **"Base Fare"** = Must include all mandatory carrier-imposed charges
- **"Flight" / "Ticket" / "Fare"** = Must include all mandatory carrier and government charges
- **"Each way"** (not "one-way") if round-trip purchase required

**MUST AVOID:**

- **"One-way" for round-trip fares** - Illegal even with disclosure
- **"Taxes and fees not included"** - Misleading; they must be included
- **"From $X"** without showing that total price is available for purchase
- **Misleading urgency** - "Only 1 seat left!" if not true
- **"Free"** unless truly free with no mandatory purchases

**RECOMMENDED PHRASES:**

- ✓ "Includes all taxes and fees"
- ✓ "Additional fees may apply for baggage, seat selection, and other optional services"
- ✓ "Total price"
- ✓ "All-in price"
- ✓ "Final price"

**CLEAR AND CONSPICUOUS REQUIREMENT:**
- Disclosures must be easily noticeable
- Readable font size
- Sufficient contrast
- Proximity to claim being disclosed
- Not hidden in fine print or requiring scrolling

---

### Q4: If we aggregate flights from multiple sources, do we have additional disclosure requirements?

**ANSWER: You have the same requirements as any ticket agent, with some additional considerations.**

**Standard Requirements (apply to all ticket agents/OTAs):**
1. Full fare advertising (all taxes/fees included)
2. Baggage fee disclosure
3. Code-share disclosure
4. Accessibility compliance

**Additional Considerations for Aggregators:**

**Price Accuracy:**
- If you display prices from airline APIs, you're responsible for accuracy
- If airline changes price, update quickly or disclose that prices may change
- DOT has fined OTAs for showing unavailable fares

**Source Attribution (Best Practice):**
- While not legally required, consider showing the source
- Example: "Price from American Airlines" vs "Price from Expedia"

**Third-Party Booking Disclosure:**
- If customer will complete booking on airline site, disclose this
- Example: "You will be redirected to [Airline] to complete booking"

**Markup Disclosure (Not Required, But Good Practice):**
- DOT does not require disclosure of OTA markup
- However, FTC general truth-in-advertising principles apply
- If you claim "lowest price" but add a markup, that could be deceptive

**Data Freshness:**
- No specific legal requirement for how often to update prices
- But showing stale prices that are no longer available = deceptive practice
- Best practice: Real-time or near-real-time pricing

**Unclear DOT Guidance:**
> "The DOT has not made a determination on whether metasearch entities and aggregators that advertise but do not sell airline tickets are ticket agents and would be covered by these rules."

**Safe Approach:** Assume you ARE covered and comply with all ticket agent requirements.

---

### Q5: What happens if an airline changes their price after we display it?

**ANSWER: You must update the price or clearly disclose it may change.**

**Legal Standard:**
- Showing a price that's no longer available = deceptive practice
- Violation of 14 CFR 399.84 and 49 USC 41712

**Safe Harbor Practices:**

**Option 1: Real-Time Pricing (Best)**
- Query airline API at time of search
- Price displayed = price available
- Update immediately when airline changes

**Option 2: Clear Disclosure**
```
NYC → LAX: $350*

*Prices are subject to availability and may change.
Final price will be confirmed before payment.
```

**Option 3: Cache with Timestamp**
```
NYC → LAX: $350
(Price as of 2:45 PM EST)
[Refresh for latest price]
```

**What NOT To Do:**
- Show cached prices from hours/days ago without disclosure
- Say "Guaranteed Price" when it's not guaranteed
- Bait-and-switch (show $350, but actually $450 at checkout)

**Best Practice Implementation:**
1. Query airlines in real-time during search
2. If caching for performance, cache for max 5-15 minutes
3. Revalidate price before user clicks "Book"
4. Show loading indicator while checking price
5. If price changed, notify user before proceeding:
   ```
   ⚠ Price Update
   The price for this flight has changed from $350 to $375.
   [Continue with new price] [Search again]
   ```

**Enforcement Example:**
FlightHub was penalized for "misleading statements regarding fare availability" - advertising fares that weren't actually available.

---

### Q6: Are there specific requirements for mobile vs desktop displays?

**ANSWER: Same requirements apply, but mobile has additional accessibility challenges.**

**Full Fare Advertising - Same on Mobile and Desktop**
- Total price must be displayed
- All taxes and fees included
- No difference in requirements

**Baggage Fee Disclosure - Same on Mobile and Desktop**
- "First screen" rule applies to mobile
- Must be visible without scrolling (or with minimal scrolling)
- Clear and conspicuous on smaller screens

**Code-Share Disclosure - Same on Mobile and Desktop**
- Must be on "first display"
- Easily viewable
- No clicking required

**Accessibility - MOBILE APPS ARE COVERED**
> "The Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) addresses digital accessibility by helping create accessible websites, mobile apps, in-flight entertainment, self-service kiosks, and communications."

**Mobile App Accessibility Requirements:**
- WCAG 2.0 Level AA applies
- Platform-specific accessibility (iOS VoiceOver, Android TalkBack)
- Touch target size adequate
- Gestures have alternatives
- Screen reader compatible
- Same testing requirements (test with users with disabilities)

**Mobile-Specific Challenges:**

1. **Limited Screen Space:**
   - Still must show total price prominently
   - Still must disclose baggage fees on first screen
   - Use progressive disclosure carefully (don't hide mandatory info)

2. **Readability:**
   - Font size adequate (WCAG requires resizable to 200%)
   - Contrast ratio 4.5:1 minimum
   - Important info not in images

3. **Touch Targets:**
   - Buttons at least 44x44 pixels (iOS) or 48x48dp (Android)
   - Adequate spacing between clickable elements

**Best Practices for Mobile Compliance:**

```
✓ GOOD Mobile Design:

┌─────────────────────────┐
│ NYC → LAX              │
│ Tue, Jan 15            │
│                        │
│ $350 total             │ ← Total price large & prominent
│ Includes all taxes     │
│                        │
│ Additional fees for    │ ← Baggage disclosure visible
│ baggage. [View fees]   │
│                        │
│ [Select Flight]        │ ← Large touch target
└─────────────────────────┘

✗ BAD Mobile Design:

┌─────────────────────────┐
│ NYC → LAX - $200       │ ← Base fare only
│ Tue, Jan 15            │
│ [Select]               │
│                        │
│ (user scrolls down)    │
│ *Taxes not included    │ ← Hidden disclosure
│ **Baggage fees apply   │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Testing Recommendation:**
- Test on actual mobile devices, not just emulators
- Test with screen readers (VoiceOver on iOS, TalkBack on Android)
- Test with different screen sizes (phones, tablets)
- Test in portrait and landscape orientations

## 9. PROHIBITED PRACTICES SUMMARY

### NEVER Do These (High Risk of Enforcement)

1. **Drip Pricing**
   - Showing base fare, then adding mandatory fees later
   - "Starting at $200" then revealing $350 total at checkout

2. **Hidden Code-Shares**
   - Not showing operating carrier on search results
   - Requiring click to see who operates the flight

3. **Misleading Availability**
   - Advertising fares that aren't actually available
   - "Only 2 seats left" when not true

4. **Delayed Refunds**
   - Taking more than 7 business days (credit card) or 20 days (other)
   - Offering only vouchers when cash refund is required

5. **Inaccessible Critical Functions**
   - Booking flow not keyboard accessible
   - Missing alt text on important images
   - Insufficient color contrast

6. **Hidden Terms**
   - Material restrictions hidden in fine print
   - Important disclaimers not clear and conspicuous

7. **False Discounts**
   - "50% off" when calculation is misleading
   - Not explaining how discount is calculated

8. **One-Way Mislabeling**
   - Calling each-way fares "one-way"

## 10. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND COMPLAINTS

### If You Receive a DOT Complaint

**DOT Process:**
1. Customer files complaint with DOT Aviation Consumer Protection
2. DOT forwards complaint to company
3. Company has 30 days to respond
4. DOT reviews and may investigate

**Your Response Should:**
- Be prompt (within 30 days)
- Be thorough and factual
- Include supporting documentation
- Explain what happened
- Explain corrective action taken
- Be professional and customer-focused

**Do NOT:**
- Ignore DOT complaints (will escalate)
- Provide false information
- Blame the customer without investigation
- Miss the response deadline

### Voluntary Disclosure

If you discover a compliance violation:
- Consider voluntary disclosure to DOT
- Implement immediate corrective action
- Document remediation efforts
- May result in reduced penalties

### How to File Comments on Proposed Rules

DOT publishes proposed rules in the Federal Register and accepts public comments:
1. Go to https://www.regulations.gov/
2. Search for DOT docket number
3. Submit comment during open comment period

**Why This Matters:** The blocked baggage fee rule was invalidated partly because DOT didn't allow proper comment on supporting studies. Participating in the rulemaking process is both a right and good business practice.

## 12. RISK ASSESSMENT FOR FLY2ANY

### Current Compliance Status (Estimate Based on Common Issues)

**HIGH RISK AREAS** (Likely Issues for New Platforms):
1. Accessibility (WCAG 2.0 Level AA) - Deadlines passed in 2015/2016
2. Real-time price accuracy from aggregated sources
3. Mobile app accessibility if you have an app

**MEDIUM RISK AREAS:**
1. Baggage fee disclosure on "first screen"
2. Code-share disclosure prominence
3. Refund processing speed (new rule effective Oct 2024)

**LIKELY COMPLIANT** (If Using Standard Practices):
1. All-in pricing (most modern platforms do this)
2. Basic consumer protection

### Recommended Next Steps

**Immediate (This Week):**
1. Run WAVE accessibility scan on booking flow
2. Verify all prices shown include taxes/fees
3. Check code-share disclosure on search results

**Short-Term (This Month):**
1. Full accessibility audit
2. Engage accessibility consultant
3. Review refund processing procedures
4. Test mobile experience

**Ongoing:**
1. Subscribe to DOT Aviation Consumer Protection updates
2. Quarterly compliance audits
3. Monitor DOT enforcement actions
4. Stay updated on blocked baggage fee rule status

## 14. FINAL NOTES AND DISCLAIMER

**This guide is based on research current as of October 2025.**

**Key Uncertainties:**
1. **Baggage Fee Disclosure Rule:** Currently blocked by court. May be re-issued. Monitor DOT announcements.
2. **Aggregator Coverage:** DOT has not definitively ruled whether aggregators that don't sell tickets are covered. Recommend assuming coverage for safety.
3. **Penalty Calculations:** "Per violation" can mean per passenger or per day. Exact calculation varies by case.

**Not Legal Advice:**
This guide is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Consult with qualified legal counsel for your specific situation.

**Action Required:**
This is a compliance guide, not a substitute for legal review. Fly2Any should:
1. Have this reviewed by aviation law counsel
2. Implement immediate compliance measures
3. Create ongoing monitoring procedures
4. Budget for accessibility remediation
5. Consider compliance insurance

**Changes to Regulations:**
DOT regulations evolve. The 2024 FAA Reauthorization Act tripled penalties and enabled new consumer protection rules. Future changes are likely. Ongoing monitoring is essential.

---

**COMPLIANCE IS NOT OPTIONAL - IT'S MANDATORY**

The penalties are severe ($75,000 per violation for consumer protection, $27,500 for accessibility), and DOT is actively enforcing. Prioritize compliance alongside feature development.

**Questions or Updates:**
Track this document in version control. Update as regulations change. Assign a compliance officer to monitor DOT announcements.
