# ✅ Real Data Booking Flow - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before**: Booking confirmation page showed mock data (`F2A-2025-XYZ789`) instead of real booking from database

**After**: Complete end-to-end booking flow with 100% real data from flight selection to confirmation

  ```

**Changes**:
- Added state for booking data and loading (Line 393-394)

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Mock Data):
```javascript
const mockBookingData = {
  bookingRef: 'F2A-2025-XYZ789',  // ❌ Hardcoded
  email: 'passenger@example.com',  // ❌ Fake email
  outboundFlight: {
    flightNumber: 'AA 1234',       // ❌ Mock data
    from: { code: 'JFK' },          // ❌ Mock data
    to: { code: 'LHR' },            // ❌ Mock data
    departure: '2025-11-15...',     // ❌ Hardcoded date
  },
  // ... more mock data
};
```

### After (Real Data):
```typescript
// Fetched from database
const booking = await fetch(`/api/admin/bookings/${bookingId}`);
// booking.bookingReference = 'FLY2A-P3K7H9'  ✅ Real
// booking.contactInfo.email = 'john@example.com'  ✅ Real
// booking.flight.segments[0].carrierCode = 'DL'  ✅ Real from Amadeus
// booking.flight.segments[0].departure.at = '2025-11-15T10:30:00'  ✅ Real
// booking.passengers[0].firstName = 'John'  ✅ Real from form
```

## 🚀 What's Working Now

### ✅ Fully Functional:
1. **Flight Search** → Real Amadeus API data
2. **Flight Selection** → Stores real flight in sessionStorage
3. **Passenger Form** → Collects real passenger data
