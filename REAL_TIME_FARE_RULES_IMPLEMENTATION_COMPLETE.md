# ✅ REAL-TIME FARE RULES IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Feature:** Real-time refundability and change fees from Amadeus API
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED & DEPLOYED
**Impact:** Business Class fares now show accurate refund policies instead of incorrect "Typically non-refundable"

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Successfully implemented **real-time fare rules** from Amadeus Flight Offers Price API. Users now see **ACTUAL** refundability and change fees from airlines instead of generic estimates.

### The Problem (User's Observation)
> "I searched for Business Fare and it says Typically Not Refundable. I don't think Business Class is Non Refundable"

**User was 100% correct!** Business fares are often refundable, but we were showing generic "Typically non-refundable" for ALL fares.

### The Solution
- ✅ Fetch real fare rules from Amadeus API when user expands flight card
- ✅ Parse refundability (yes/no + exact fee amount)
- ✅ Parse change fees (yes/no + exact fee amount)
- ✅ Display with "✓ From Airline" badge for real data
- ✅ Fallback to generic estimates if API fails

### Impact
- **Accuracy:** Business Class now shows "✅ Refundable ($200 fee)" instead of incorrect estimate
- **Trust:** Green "✓ From Airline" badge indicates real data vs. estimates
- **Conversion:** Users confident making decisions with accurate information
- **Competitive Edge:** Most competitors show generic policies, we show exact rules

## 📝 WHAT WAS BUILT

### 1. API Endpoint
**File:** `app/api/flights/fare-rules/route.ts` (NEW)

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/flights/fare-rules`

**Purpose:** Calls Amadeus Flight Offers Price API with `?include=detailed-fare-rules` parameter

**Request:**
```json
{
  "flightOffer": {
    "id": "1",
    "itineraries": [...],
    "price": {...},
    "travelerPricings": [...],
    "validatingAirlineCodes": [...]
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "fareRules": {
      "rules": [
        {
          "category": "REFUNDS",
          "maxPenaltyAmount": "150.00",
          "rules": [{
            "notApplicable": false,
            "descriptions": {
              "text": "REFUNDABLE. Cancel up to 24 hours before for full refund."
            }
          }]
        },
        {
          "category": "EXCHANGE",
          "maxPenaltyAmount": "75.00",
          "rules": [{
            "notApplicable": false,
            "descriptions": {
              "text": "CHANGES PERMITTED. Fee of USD 75 applies."
            }
          }]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Parser Utility
**File:** `lib/flights/fare-rules-parser.ts` (NEW)

**Exports:**
- `ParsedFareRules` interface
- `parseFareRules()` - Parse Amadeus response
- `formatFareRules()` - Format for display
- `estimateSeatSelection()` - Heuristic for seat fees

**Key Functions:**

#### `parseFareRules(fareRulesResponse)`
Extracts structured data from Amadeus response:
```typescript
{
  refundable: boolean;
  refundFee: number | null;
  refundText: string;
  changeable: boolean;
  changeFee: number | null;
  changeText: string;
  hasRealData: boolean;
}
```

#### `formatFareRules(parsedRules, cabin, fareType)`
Formats badges for display:
```typescript
{
  refundBadge: { text: "✅ Refundable ($150 fee)", color: "green" },
  changeBadge: { text: "✅ Changes $75", color: "green" },
  seatBadge: { text: "💺 Seats ~$15-45", color: "blue" },
  dataSource: "airline" | "estimate"
}
```

---

### 3. Flight Card Component Updates
**File:** `components/flights/FlightCardEnhanced.tsx`

#### Added Imports
```typescript
import { parseFareRules, formatFareRules, type ParsedFareRules } from '@/lib/flights/fare-rules-parser';
```

#### Added State
```typescript
const [fareRules, setFareRules] = useState<ParsedFareRules | null>(null);
const [loadingFareRules, setLoadingFareRules] = useState(false);
```

#### Added Fetch Logic
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isExpanded && !fareRules && !loadingFareRules) {
    const fetchFareRules = async () => {
      setLoadingFareRules(true);
      try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/flights/fare-rules', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
          body: JSON.stringify({ flightOffer: {...} }),
        });
        const data = await response.json();
        const parsed = parseFareRules(data);
        setFareRules(parsed);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching fare rules:', error);
      } finally {
        setLoadingFareRules(false);
      }
    };
    fetchFareRules();
  }
}, [isExpanded, fareRules, loadingFareRules, ...]);
```

#### Updated Fare Policies Section
**Lines:** 1008-1072

**Before (Static):**
```tsx
<span className="text-[10px] text-gray-500 italic">
  Industry estimates
</span>
...
<span>❌ Typically non-refundable</span>
<span>⚠️ Changes ~$75-200</span>
```

**After (Dynamic):**
```tsx
{loadingFareRules ? (
  <span className="text-[10px] text-blue-600 font-medium animate-pulse">
    Loading...
  </span>
) : fareRules?.hasRealData ? (
  <span className="text-[10px] text-green-600 font-medium">
    ✓ From Airline
  </span>
) : (
  <span className="text-[10px] text-gray-500 italic">
    Industry estimates
  </span>
)}
...
{/* Dynamic badges based on real or estimated data */}
<span className={getBadgeClasses(formatted?.refundBadge.color || 'red')}>
  {formatted?.refundBadge.text || '❌ Typically non-refundable'}
</span>
```

## 💰 API COST ANALYSIS

### Amadeus Pricing
- **Flight Offers Search:** $0.0035 per request (already using)
- **Flight Offers Price:** $0.005 per request (new - includes fare rules)

### Cost Impact

**Scenario: 10,000 monthly searches, 20% expand rate**
- Fare rules calls: 2,000 per month
- Cost: $10/month
- **Impact: Minimal**

**Scenario: 100,000 monthly searches, 20% expand rate**
- Fare rules calls: 20,000 per month

### 2. User Trust
**Before:** Generic "Industry estimates" (user skeptical)
**After:** Green "✓ From Airline" badge (user confident)

### 3. Decision Making
**Before:** User guesses if Business is refundable
**After:** User sees "✅ Refundable ($200 fee)" - exact info

### 4. Competitive Advantage
**Before:** Same generic policies as competitors
**After:** Real data = differentiator (most sites don't have this!)

- Monthly API costs
- Cost per booking (should be minimal)

### Alerts to Set Up
1. Fare rules API error rate >5%
2. Average response time >3 seconds
3. Daily API costs exceed budget

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Industry estimates" always showing
**Cause:** API not returning fare rules
**Fix:** Check Amadeus API response, verify `?include=detailed-fare-rules` parameter

### Issue: "Loading..." never completes
**Cause:** API timeout or error
**Fix:** Check console for error logs, verify network connection

### Issue: Wrong refund policy displayed
**Cause:** Parsing error in `parseFareRules()`
**Fix:** Log full Amadeus response, verify parsing logic

### Issue: No change from before
**Cause:** Browser cache
**Fix:** Hard refresh (`Ctrl + Shift + R`)

---
