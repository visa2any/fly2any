## 1. Playwright Browser Installation Issue - RESOLVED

### Problem Identified
The MCP Playwright tool was looking for browser versions that didn't match the installed versions:
- **Expected**: chromium-1179, firefox-1488, webkit-2182
- **Actually Installed**: chromium-1187/1194, firefox-1490/1495, webkit-2203/2215

### Solution Applied
Created custom Playwright scripts using the project's local @playwright/test installation (v1.56.0), which successfully accessed the correct browser versions.

### Files Created
- `C:\Users\Power\fly2any-fresh\screenshot-script.mjs`
- `C:\Users\Power\fly2any-fresh\analyze-page.mjs`
- `C:\Users\Power\fly2any-fresh\screenshot-expanded.mjs`
- `C:\Users\Power\fly2any-fresh\final-screenshots.mjs`

### Result
