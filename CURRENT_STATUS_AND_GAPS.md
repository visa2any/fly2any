## ❌ CRITICAL GAPS (Blocking Production Launch)

### **🔴 TIER 1: MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY**

#### **1. Global Header/Footer Integration** ❌ CRITICAL
```
Current Status:
- Header/Footer only on home-new page
- Results page has no header/footer
- No global layout wrapper

What's Missing:
❌ app/layout.tsx global layout with Header/Footer
❌ Consistent navigation across all pages
❌ Language switcher not persisted across pages

Impact: Unprofessional, broken navigation
Priority: CRITICAL - 30 minutes
```

#### **2. Amadeus API Production Credentials** ❌ CRITICAL
```
Current Status:
- Using test API (test.api.amadeus.com)
- Falls back to mock data on errors
- Working but limited

What's Missing:
❌ Production API credentials
❌ Redis caching layer
❌ Rate limiting handling
❌ Request retry logic
❌ API performance monitoring

Impact: Can't handle real traffic, slow searches
Priority: CRITICAL - But needs user to provide credentials
```

#### **3. Booking Flow** ❌ CRITICAL
```
Current Status:
- "Select Flight" button does nothing
- No passenger details form
- No payment integration
- No confirmation page

What's Missing:
❌ app/flights/booking/page.tsx
❌ Passenger details form
❌ Seat selection interface
❌ Payment integration (Stripe/PayPal)
❌ Booking confirmation
❌ Email confirmation
❌ Order management

Impact: USERS CANNOT ACTUALLY BOOK FLIGHTS
Priority: CRITICAL - 4-6 hours work
```

#### **4. Performance Optimization** ❌ HIGH
```
Current Status:
- Renders all flights at once
- No virtualization
- No pagination
- Slow with 50+ results

What's Missing:
❌ Virtual scrolling (react-window)
❌ Infinite scroll / pagination
❌ Image lazy loading
❌ Result caching
❌ Optimistic UI updates

Impact: Slow performance, poor UX with many results
Priority: HIGH - 2-3 hours
```

### **🟡 TIER 2: COMPETITIVE GAPS**

#### **5. Map Integration** ❌ MEDIUM
```
What's Missing:
❌ Route visualization on map
❌ Layover airport markers
❌ Nearby airport suggestions
❌ Toggle map/list view

Impact: Less competitive vs Skyscanner/Google Flights
Priority: MEDIUM - 3-4 hours
```

#### **6. Save/Favorite Backend** ❌ MEDIUM
```
Current Status:
- Heart icon exists in FlightCardEnhanced
- No backend to persist saved flights
- No saved flights page

What's Missing:
❌ API endpoint: POST /api/flights/save
❌ Database table: saved_flights
❌ GET /api/flights/saved
❌ DELETE /api/flights/saved/:id
❌ app/flights/saved/page.tsx

Impact: Users lose saved flights on refresh
Priority: MEDIUM - 2-3 hours
```

#### **7. Price Alerts Backend** ❌ MEDIUM
```
Current Status:
- PriceAlerts component exists
- No backend to actually send alerts
- No email service integration

What's Missing:
❌ API endpoint: POST /api/price-alerts
❌ Database table: price_alerts
❌ Background job to check prices
❌ Email service (SendGrid/Resend)
❌ Alert notification system

Impact: Price tracking feature doesn't work
Priority: MEDIUM - 3-4 hours
```

### **🟢 TIER 3: ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES**

#### **8. Real ML Price Prediction** ❌ LOW
```
Current Status:
- SmartWait™ uses mock prediction logic
- Based on simple heuristics
- No real historical data

What We Could Add:
- Train actual ML model on historical prices
- Real-time price trend analysis
- Collaborative filtering
- Seasonal pattern detection

Impact: More accurate predictions
Priority: LOW - Nice to have later
```

#### **9. Real-time Social Proof** ❌ LOW
```
Current Status:
- Static badges like "Best Value"
- No real user activity data

What We Could Add:
- "142 people booked this today" (real)
- "3 people viewing this now" (live WebSocket)
- Recent bookings feed
- Real user reviews

Impact: Better conversion psychology
Priority: LOW - After we have real users
```

#### **10. Advanced Features** ❌ LOW
```
Future Enhancements:
- Price freeze feature
- Bundle deals (flight + hotel)
- Loyalty program integration
- Split ticket finder
- Hidden city detection
- Layover experience planner
- Climate impact calculator
- AR seat preview

Priority: LOW - Phase 2+ features
```
