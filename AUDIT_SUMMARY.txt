KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

WHAT EXISTS (Excellent Foundation):
  ✓ 12 AI UI components fully built
  ✓ Global integration on ALL pages via GlobalLayout
  ✓ Conversation flow system wired to UI
  ✓ Typing simulation with 3 phase animation
  ✓ 12 specialist consultants with profiles
  ✓ Flight search integration complete
  ✓ Conversation persistence (save/resume)
  ✓ Error handling framework (15+ error types)
  ✓ Language support (EN, PT, ES)
  ✓ Emotion detection system
  ✓ Proactive suggestions generation
  ✓ Analytics tracking throughout
  ✓ Consultant avatar system with images
  ✓ Consultant profile modal (credentials/expertise)

WHAT'S MISSING (Critical Gaps):

1. NO LANGUAGE AUTO-DETECTION UI
   Library exists, not connected to popup
   Users must manually select language from header
   Impact: Non-English speakers have poor onboarding
   
2. NO ANIMATED CONSULTANT HANDOFF
   Specialist switching happens silently
   Users don't understand team changes
   Impact: Feels disconnected, loses trust
   
3. LIMITED ERROR STATE DISPLAY
   15+ error types handled but basic UI only
   No retry buttons, visual indicators minimal
   Impact: Users give up instead of trying again
   
4. NO MULTI-STAGE LOADING INDICATORS
   Shows simple spinner, no progress breakdown
   Users don't know what AI is doing
   Impact: Feels slow, creates frustration
   
5. NO CONSULTANT PERSONALITY IN MESSAGES
   Profiles exist with personalities, not used in text
   All consultants sound identical
   Impact: Feels generic, not personal
   
6. NO VOICE/AUDIO FEATURES
   Text-only interface, no mobile voice support
   Impact: Mobile users find typing awkward
   
7. NO ADVANCED SEARCH FILTERS IN CHAT
   Backend ready, frontend incomplete
   Users can't refine searches without typing
   Impact: Tedious user experience
   
8. NO PROACTIVE SUGGESTION ANIMATIONS
   Suggestions appear static, don't draw attention
   Impact: Users miss helpful suggestions
   
9. NO AUTH INTEGRATION WITH CHAT
   Sign-up system exists, not triggered by chat
   No smart moments to prompt account creation
   Impact: Low conversion, lost sign-up opportunities
   
10. NO MOBILE OPTIMIZATIONS
    Responsive but not mobile-native feel
    No swipe gestures, limited touch optimization
    Impact: Mobile users have suboptimal experience
