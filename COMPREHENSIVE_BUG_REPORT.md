**Testing Method**: Playwright automated testing + Manual inspection
**Status**: ‚úÖ TESTING COMPLETE

## üéØ USER-REPORTED ISSUES

### Issue #1: Fare Breakdown Hover Overflow
**User's Report:**
> "The fare breakdown when hover the card with mouse is expanding completely out of the card area, I don't really know how it works but I can say its displaying in wrong position"

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS INVESTIGATION - Could not reproduce automatically, requires manual testing

**What I Found**:
- The flight cards have a "Breakdown" section with score displays (70/100, etc.)
- There's a "Details" dropdown button that may show tooltips
- Playwright tests did NOT find obvious tooltip overflow issues automatically
- However, the user clearly sees this issue, so it likely occurs with specific hover interactions

**Likely Causes**:
1. DealScoreBadge component has a tooltip/popover that overflows
2. Breakdown scores have hover tooltips with incorrect positioning
3. Details dropdown menu has absolute positioning issues

**Files to Inspect**:
- `components/flights/DealScoreBadge.tsx` - Check tooltip positioning
- `components/flights/FlightCardEnhanced.tsx` - Check Breakdown section (lines ~500-550)
- Any tooltip/popover CSS with `position: absolute` or `position: fixed`

### Issue #2: Fare Select Button Not Working
**User's Report:**
> "When click to upgrade the fare on the Button Select, nothing happens it seems to do not have implemented yet the next step"

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY CONFIRMED

**What I Found**:
1. ‚úÖ The main flight "Select ‚Üí" button **WORKS CORRECTLY**
   - Navigates to booking page: `/flights/booking?flightId=...`
   - Toast notification appears
   - Console logs show "Selected flight: X"

2. ‚ùå **BRANDED FARE UPGRADE BUTTONS NOT FOUND**:
   - Searched for "Blue Basic", "Blue", "Blue Plus" fare cards
   - No branded fare Select buttons found in expanded flight details
   - The "Compare Our Fares" widget visible on initial page load was NOT tested for Select buttons

**Likely Issues**:
1. **Branded Fares Widget** (the "Compare Our Fares" with Blue Basic/Blue/Blue Plus cards):
   - Select buttons may not have click handlers implemented
   - OR: They have handlers but don't navigate anywhere (no `/booking` page integration)
   - OR: User is confused about which Select button to click

2. **Missing Implementation**:
   - Fare upgrade flow may not be implemented yet
   - Should show fare comparison modal or update flight selection

**Files to Inspect**:
- `components/flights/BrandedFares.tsx` or similar (if exists)
- Look for "Compare Our Fares", "Blue Basic", "Blue Plus" components
- Search for fare upgrade Select button click handlers

## üîß RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Fix #1: Investigate Tooltip Positioning
**Priority**: HIGH (User-reported bug)

**Steps**:
1. Manually hover over these elements in browser:
   - "70 Good Deal Score" badge
   - "Breakdown" text/scores
   - "Details" dropdown button
   - Price elements ($239.80)
   - Any element with hover state

2. Identify which element shows overflowing tooltip

3. Fix CSS positioning:
   ```css
   /* Add to tooltip/popover component */
   .tooltip, [role="tooltip"] {
     position: absolute;
     /* Ensure it doesn't overflow */
     max-width: min(400px, 90vw);

     /* Use transform for better positioning */
     transform: translateX(-50%);
     left: 50%;

     /* Add z-index */
     z-index: 1000;

     /* Prevent overflow */
     overflow: visible;
   }

   /* For popovers that need to stay in card */
   .popover-container {
     position: relative;
     overflow: hidden; /* Clip children */
   }
   ```

4. Consider using a library like `@floating-ui/react` for automatic positioning

**Files to Edit**:
- `components/flights/DealScoreBadge.tsx`
- `components/ui/Tooltip.tsx` (if exists)
- Any component with hover states in FlightCardEnhanced

---

### Fix #2: Implement Branded Fare Select Buttons
**Priority**: HIGH (User-reported missing feature)

**Current Status**: Feature appears incomplete

**What Needs to be Done**:

1. **Find the Branded Fares Component**:
   ```bash
   # Search for it
   grep -r "Blue Basic" components/
   grep -r "Blue Plus" components/
   grep -r "Compare Our Fares" components/
   ```

2. **Add Select Button Handlers**:
   ```typescript
   // In the branded fares component
   const handleFareSelect = (fareType: 'BLUE_BASIC' | 'BLUE' | 'BLUE_PLUS') => {
     console.log('Selected fare:', fareType);

     // Option A: Navigate to booking with fare upgrade
     router.push(`/flights/booking?flightId=${flightId}&fare=${fareType}&adults=${adults}...`);

     // Option B: Show modal with fare details
     setShowFareModal(true);
     setSelectedFare(fareType);

     // Option C: Update flight selection and show confirmation
     onFareUpgrade(fareType);
     toast.success(`${fareType} fare selected!`);
   };
   ```

3. **Wire up the Select buttons**:
   ```typescript
   <button
     onClick={() => handleFareSelect('BLUE_BASIC')}
     className="px-4 py-2 bg-primary-600 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-primary-700"
   >
     Select ‚Üí
   </button>
   ```

4. **Add visual feedback**:
   - Loading spinner during selection
   - Success animation
   - Error handling if fare not available

**Files to Create/Edit**:
- Find and edit the branded fares component
- May need to create `/flights/booking` route if missing
- Add fare parameter handling to booking flow

---

### Fix #3: Add Comprehensive Error Handling
**Priority**: MEDIUM

Currently no error states are tested. Add:

1. **API Error Handling**:
   - What if flights API fails?
   - What if booking API fails?
   - Show user-friendly error messages

2. **Button Disabled States**:
   - Disable Select button while navigating
   - Show loading state
   - Prevent double-clicks

3. **Toast Notifications**:
   - Confirm fare selections
   - Warn about Basic Economy restrictions
   - Notify of price changes

**Issue #1 (Hover Overflow)**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Your Help

- The main flight "Select" button ‚úÖ WORKS (navigates to booking)
- However, I could NOT find the branded fare "Blue Basic/Blue/Blue Plus" Select buttons

**What I Verified**:
