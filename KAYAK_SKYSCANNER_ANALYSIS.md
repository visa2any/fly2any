# ULTRA-DEEP COMPETITOR ANALYSIS: KAYAK & SKYSCANNER
## Fare Transparency and Baggage Display Strategies

**Analysis Date:** October 19, 2025
**Focus Areas:** Fare transparency, baggage display, booking flow, UX patterns
**Competitors Analyzed:** KAYAK, Skyscanner, Google Flights (reference)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This analysis reveals critical differences in how KAYAK and Skyscanner approach fare transparency and baggage display. KAYAK leads in **proactive baggage fee transparency** with dedicated tools, while Skyscanner excels in **clean visual design** and **flexible search capabilities**. Both platforms struggle with the industry-wide challenge of preventing "baggage fee surprise" at checkout, though they approach solutions differently.

### Key Finding: Industry Gap
**Neither platform has fully solved the "baggage surprise" problem**, creating an opportunity for innovation in:
- Per-segment baggage breakdown for complex itineraries
- Inline baggage displays before expansion
- Real-time total cost calculation including all fees

---

## 1. KAYAK DEEP DIVE

### 1.1 Fare Transparency Strategy

#### **Fare Class Selector (Industry First - 2017)**
KAYAK was the **first metasearch** to clearly display Basic Economy fare differences:

**Implementation:**
- Two dropdown menus: "Basic Economy" and "Main Cabin"
- Main price shows Basic Economy fare
- Main Cabin dropdown shows upgrade cost
- Price breakdown for each cabin class with included amenities

**Example Display:**
```
$189  Basic Economy  ▼
$234  Main Cabin     ▼
      (+$45 for no change fees, seat selection, overhead bin)
```

**Trust Signals:**
- Clear labeling of fare restrictions
- Side-by-side comparison enabled
- No hidden default selections

**Effectiveness:**
- Addresses post-2013 Basic Economy complexity
- Helps users make informed decisions
- Typical price difference: $15-$80 per one-way flight

---

### 1.2 Baggage Display Architecture

#### **Baggage Fee Assistant (Flagship Feature)**

**Primary Interface:**
- **Toolbar positioned on top of search results**
- Interactive slider/selector for bag count
- Real-time price updates as users adjust baggage
- Suitcase icon inline with fare display

**How It Works:**
1. User selects number of carry-on + checked bags
2. Results "magically update" with new prices
3. Hover over suitcase icon reveals exact fare breakdown
4. Shows "REAL cost" including baggage for each airline

**Visual Language:**
- **Suitcase icon** with interactive hover
- **Red suitcase with line through it** for Basic Economy (no bag included)
- Inline badge/indicator on flight card
- Fee breakdown on hover interaction

**Comparative Transparency:**
> "Since baggage fees can vary between airlines, this is a great way to see an actual cost comparison without having to search separately for each airline's baggage fee policy."

**User Flow:**
```
Search → Select bag count → Results update → Hover icon → See breakdown → Compare total costs
```

---

#### **Strengths:**
1. **Proactive fee calculation** - users see true cost before clicking
2. **Real-time updates** - dynamic pricing as selections change
3. **Comparative clarity** - easy to compare airlines with different baggage policies
4. **Inline display** - no need to expand cards to see basic info
5. **Hover interaction** - detailed breakdown available without cluttering UI

#### **Weaknesses:**
1. **Not visible by default** - users must activate Fee Assistant
2. **Limited per-segment detail** - unclear how multi-leg flights are handled
3. **No visual differentiation** for complex itineraries (e.g., "1 bag outbound, 0 return")
4. **Toolbar dependency** - requires user action to enable

---

### 1.3 Booking Flow & Add-Ons

**After "Select" Click:**
- Redirect to airline or OTA (Online Travel Agency)
- KAYAK doesn't control final booking experience
- Fee Assistant data may not transfer to booking site

**Critical Gap:**
Users see transparent pricing in KAYAK but may encounter different fees at checkout on partner sites, creating potential trust issues.

---

### 1.4 Innovation & Technology

#### **AI & Machine Learning (Since 2004)**

**Core AI Features:**
1. **Price Prediction with Confidence Meter**
   - Predicts if prices will rise/fall in next 7 days
   - Confidence levels: 55-95%
   - **2025 Accuracy: 85%** (tested on Air France European network)
   - Uses billions of price points + seasonal trends

2. **KAYAK.ai Platform (2024-2025)**
   - AI Mode with ChatGPT integration
   - **Only platform with real-time pricing in conversational search**
   - Natural language trip planning
   - Personalized recommendations based on budget/preferences

3. **Predictive Rate Caching**
   - ML-powered hotel/flight rate predictions
   - Fare accuracy models
   - Flight price forecasting (since 2013)

**Competitive Advantage:**
KAYAK claims more "agile and accurate" ML models than Hopper, Skyscanner, or defunct Fareceast.

---

### 1.5 UX Strengths & Weaknesses

#### **Strengths:**
- **Speed**: 23% faster searches than competitors
- **Comprehensive filters** available immediately
- **Fee transparency tools** (baggage, credit card fees)
- **Price prediction** with statistical confidence
- **Detailed airline information** including baggage policies

#### **Weaknesses:**
- **Busier interface** - information dense
- **Learning curve** for Fee Assistant
- **Mobile UX** less polished than Skyscanner
- **Toolbar clutter** - many options can overwhelm

#### **Best For:**
Tech-savvy travelers who value efficiency, detailed data, and comprehensive filtering options.

---

## 2. SKYSCANNER DEEP DIVE

### 2.1 Fare Display Strategy

#### **Transparency Approach**
Skyscanner "leans into transparency" with:
- Flags for baggage fees
- Basic Economy fare alerts
- Filter-based approach vs. inline display

**Key Difference from KAYAK:**
- Skyscanner emphasizes **filtering** (show only flights with bags)
- KAYAK emphasizes **calculation** (show all flights with bag costs added)

---

### 2.2 Baggage Display Architecture

#### **Baggage Filter System**

**Implementation:**
1. **Initial Search** - prices shown without baggage
2. **Baggage Filter** - select "Cabin bag" or "Checked bag"
3. **Filtered Results** - only shows flights meeting baggage requirements
4. **Price Display** - shows prices both with/without baggage (when charged)

**User Flow:**
```
Search → Apply baggage filter → See filtered results → Compare prices
```

**Visual Language:**
- Baggage icons in filter panel
- Price display indicates if baggage included
- Links to airline for detailed pricing

---

#### **Strengths:**
1. **Cleaner interface** - less cluttered than KAYAK
2. **Mobile-first design** - excellent mobile UX
3. **Filter precision** - only see flights that meet your needs
4. **Color-coded pricing** - cheapest flights visually highlighted
5. **Simpler decision-making** - fewer options to process

#### **Weaknesses:**
1. **Hidden fees common** - "listed price skips baggage fees or seat selection"
2. **Post-search filtering** - requires extra step vs. KAYAK's inline display
3. **No real-time calculator** - can't see impact of adding bags to all results
4. **Limited transparency** - 62% of users experience hidden charges at payment
5. **No per-segment breakdown** - multi-leg baggage rules unclear
6. **Redirect complexity** - transferred to OTA with different policies

---

### 2.3 Booking Flow & Add-Ons

**Skyscanner as Metasearch:**
- Does NOT directly sell flights
- Redirects to OTA or airline after selection
- "Select" button shows all OTAs offering the flight

**Add-Ons Process:**
1. User clicks "Select"
2. Redirected to OTA/airline booking site
3. **All add-ons handled by partner site:**
   - Luggage
   - Meals
   - Lounge passes
   - Seat selection
   - Travel insurance

**Critical Issue:**
> "Sometimes the listed price skips baggage fees or seat selection, which can lead to price increases at checkout."

**Seat Selection Fees:**
Some OTAs charge extra for seat assignment (free on airline website), creating price discrepancies.

**Best Practice Warning:**
> "If you think you'll need extra baggage, it's almost always cheaper to add it during the initial booking process rather than adding it later."

---

- Type "Everywhere" as destination
- Shows global destinations ranked by price
- Combine with flexible dates
- **Price calendar** with color-coded daily prices
- "Whole month" view for cheapest dates
- "Cheapest month" feature

**Limitation:**
Calendar prices are not live-updating; based on recent user searches, creating data gaps.

---

---

## 4. VISUAL LANGUAGE & DESIGN PATTERNS

### 4.1 Iconography Standards

**Baggage Icons:**
- ✅ **Suitcase/Luggage** - Checked bag included
- 🚫 **Crossed-out suitcase** - No bag included (Basic Economy)
- 🎒 **Backpack** - Carry-on/cabin bag
- 🏷️ **Dollar sign + suitcase** - Paid baggage (fee applies)
- ⚠️ **Warning triangle** - Restrictions apply

**Color Schemes:**
- 🟢 **Green** - Included/Free
- 🔴 **Red** - Restrictions/Not included
- 🟠 **Orange** - Warning/Pay extra
- ⚫ **Gray** - Neutral/Standard

**KAYAK Specific:**
- Red suitcase with diagonal line = Basic Economy, no bag
- Hover reveals breakdown (interaction design)

---

### 4.2 Typography & Hierarchy

**Price Display Patterns:**
```
$189  ← Large, bold (main price)
$234  ← Secondary price (upgrade option)
+$45  ← Delta display (upgrade cost)
```

**Baggage Fee Display:**
```
✓ 1 checked bag included        ← Green checkmark
🚫 Carry-on only (Basic Economy) ← Red warning
+$35 1st checked bag            ← Orange paid add-on
```

---

### 4.3 Layout Patterns

**Collapsed Card (Before Expansion):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Airline Logo    JFK → MIA    $189      │
│ 8:00 AM - 11:30 AM  🎒 Carry-on only   │
│                     [More details ▼]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**KAYAK Fee Assistant:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Bags: [0 carry-on ▼] [1 checked ▼]    │ ← Toolbar
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Flight results below with updated prices│
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## 5. ANTI-PATTERNS & WHAT NOT TO DO

### 5.1 Dark Patterns Identified

**Industry-Wide Issues (62-78% of users affected):**

1. **Hidden Fees at Checkout**
   - ❌ Only revealing true cost at final payment step
   - ❌ "Drip pricing" - fees added incrementally
   - ❌ Artificial scarcity warnings ("Only 2 seats left!")

2. **Pre-Selected Add-Ons**
   - ❌ Default selections for upgrades ($12 premium, $1 carbon offset)
   - ❌ Require unchecking to avoid charges
   - ❌ Small fonts for opt-out options

3. **Seat Selection Tricks**
   - ❌ Free seats hidden under tabs
   - ❌ "Continue without selecting seats" link buried
   - ❌ Paid seats prominently displayed, free seats buried

4. **Fear-Based Design**
   - ❌ Red warning boxes making Basic Economy "sound terrible"
   - ❌ Scary icons with negative language
   - ❌ Intimidating messages about every restriction

5. **Forced Actions**
   - ❌ Must view 10+ extras before continuing
   - ❌ Cannot skip add-on screens
   - ❌ "Basket sneaking" - items added without consent

**Financial Impact:**
> Airlines using dark patterns boost revenue per passenger by 15-25% but damage trust and brand loyalty.

---

### 5.2 Specific Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**DON'T:**
1. Show base fare prominently, total cost in fine print
2. Pre-select baggage, insurance, or upgrades
3. Use red/scary language for legitimate fare options
4. Hide "no thanks" or "continue without" buttons
5. Make free options harder to find than paid options
6. Display cached prices without "prices may have changed" warnings
7. Require sign-in at unexpected points in booking flow
8. Show different prices in search vs. checkout
9. Use countdown timers or fake scarcity ("2 seats left!")
10. Auto-check optional services

**Real User Impact:**
- 78% cite cost as travel consideration
- 62% experience unexpected fees at payment
- 30% encounter surprise costs during purchase
- Users pay **108% more** than advertised fare on average due to dark patterns

---

### 5.3 Regulatory Context

**EU Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008:**
- ✅ **Total price MUST be shown first** (all taxes, unavoidable fees)
- ✅ Breakdown of components required (fare + taxes + airport charges)
- ✅ Optional supplements must be opt-in, clearly labeled
- ✅ "Unavoidable and foreseeable" fees included in initial price

**US Trend (2025):**
- Growing pressure for "No Hidden Fees Act"
- Industry moving toward transparency
- Consumer protection increasing

**Key Lesson:**
Build for transparency NOW - regulations will only get stricter.

---

## 6. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

### 6.1 Top 5 Patterns to Implement

#### **1. KAYAK-Style Baggage Fee Calculator (High Priority)**

**What:**
- Real-time baggage fee calculation in search results
- Toolbar or inline selector: "Traveling with: [0 carry-on] [1 checked]"
- Prices update dynamically across ALL results
- Suitcase icon with hover breakdown

**Why:**
- Prevents "baggage surprise" at checkout
- Enables true cost comparison across airlines
- KAYAK's most praised feature by users
- Addresses 62% of users who experience hidden fee shock

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Pseudo-code
<BaggageSelector
  onChange={(carryOn, checked) => {
    updateAllFlightPrices(carryOn, checked);
  }}
/>

{flights.map(flight => (
  <FlightCard
    basePrice={flight.basePrice}
    baggageFees={calculateBaggageFees(flight, selectedBags)}
    totalPrice={flight.basePrice + baggageFees}
    icon={<SuitcaseIcon onClick={showFeeBreakdown} />}
  />
))}
```

**Trust Signal:**
Show formula: `$189 base + $35 bag = $224 total`

---

#### **2. Per-Segment Baggage Breakdown (Innovation Opportunity)**

**What:**
For round-trip and multi-city flights, show baggage rules PER LEG:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Outbound: JFK → MIA                     │
│ ✓ 1 checked bag included                │
│                                         │
│ Return: MIA → JFK                       │
│ 🚫 Carry-on only (+$35 for checked)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why:**
- **No competitor does this well**
- Prevents confusion about "1 bag on outbound, 0 on return"
- Critical for codeshare/partner flights with different policies
- Handles separate tickets vs. single ticket scenarios

**Edge Cases to Handle:**
- Different airlines on outbound vs. return
- Codeshare flights (operated by vs. marketed by)
- Through-checked bags vs. re-check requirements

---

#### **3. Visual Baggage Timeline (Unique to fly2any)**

**What:**
Timeline view showing baggage allowance changes across journey:

```
JFK ──[✓ 1 bag]──► MIA ──[🚫 Carry-on only]──► JFK
8:00 AM           11:30 AM   2:00 PM           5:30 PM
```

**Why:**
- Instant visual comprehension
- No need to read detailed text
- Handles complex multi-segment trips elegantly
- Mobile-friendly (horizontal scroll)

**Inspiration:**
Flight trackers show aircraft position on timeline - apply same concept to baggage rules.

---

#### **4. Confidence-Based Price Prediction (KAYAK Model)**

**What:**
```
Current Price: $189
Prediction: Likely to rise ↗️
Confidence: 78%
```

**Why:**
- Builds trust through transparency about uncertainty
- Helps users make informed booking decisions
- KAYAK's 85% accuracy is impressive
- Differentiates from competitors

**Data Sources:**
- Historical pricing for route
- Seasonal trends
- Days until departure
- Current search volume

**Display:**
- Color-coded (green = good price, red = likely to rise)
- Percentage confidence (55-95% range)
- "Book now" vs. "Wait" recommendation

---

#### **5. Expanded Card Fare Comparison Table (Like Google Flights)**

**What:**
When user expands flight card, show fare class comparison:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Basic        Standard      Plus          │
│ Price        $189         $234          $289          │
│ Carry-on     ✓            ✓             ✓             │
│ Checked bag  🚫           ✓ 1 free      ✓ 2 free      │
│ Seat select  🚫           ✓             ✓ Priority    │
│ Changes      🚫           $75 fee       Free          │
│              [Select]     [Select]      [Select]      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why:**
- Side-by-side comparison at point of decision
- Clear value proposition for each tier
- Prevents post-booking regret
- Reduces support inquiries

**UX Note:**
Only show when multiple fare classes available (don't clutter single-option flights).

---

### 6.2 Top 3 Things to Avoid

#### **1. Pre-Selected Add-Ons (Dark Pattern)**

**DON'T:**
```typescript
// Bad - pre-checked
<Checkbox checked={true}>Add baggage insurance ($15)</Checkbox>
```

**DO:**
```typescript
// Good - opt-in only
<Checkbox checked={false}>Add baggage insurance ($15)</Checkbox>
```

**Why:**
- Violates EU regulations (opt-in required)
- Damages user trust (108% price inflation from dark patterns)
- High support burden (refund requests)
- Brand reputation damage

---

#### **2. Hiding Total Cost Until Checkout**

**DON'T:**
Show `$189` in search results, reveal `$259` at checkout (after adding unavoidable fees).

**DO:**
Show `$259` upfront with breakdown available:
```
$259 total
  $189 base fare
  + $35 baggage
  + $25 seat selection
  + $10 taxes
```

**Why:**
- 62% of users report fee shock at payment
- EU law requires total price first
- Reduces cart abandonment (users feel deceived)
- Builds long-term trust

---

#### **3. Fear-Based Basic Economy Warnings**

**DON'T:**
```
⚠️ WARNING: BASIC ECONOMY ⚠️
❌ NO CHANGES ALLOWED - EVER
❌ NO REFUNDS - YOU WILL LOSE ALL MONEY
❌ NO SEAT SELECTION - YOU MIGHT BE SEPARATED
❌ NO OVERHEAD BIN ACCESS - CARRY-ON DENIED
❌ BOARDS LAST - EXPECT DELAYS
```

**DO:**
```
Basic Economy - $189
🎒 Personal item included
🚫 No checked bag (add for $35)
🚫 Seat assigned at gate
ℹ️ View full fare rules
```

**Why:**
- Red scare tactics decrease conversions
- Legitimate fare option, not a "warning"
- Neutral language maintains trust
- Icon language clearer than text blocks

**Better Approach:**
Frame as "what's included" vs. "what's restricted" - positive framing.

---

### 6.3 Innovation Opportunities (Competitors Are Missing)

#### **1. AI Baggage Recommendations**

**Concept:**
```
Based on your trip:
- 3-day weekend → Personal item likely sufficient
- 10-day international → Consider 1 checked bag
- Family of 4 → Save $40 with bag bundles
```

**Why:**
- Skyscanner has AI memory for preferences
- KAYAK has ML for price predictions
- **No one applies AI to baggage recommendations**

**Data Sources:**
- Trip duration
- Destination (beach = more gear)
- Traveler count
- Historical behavior

---

#### **2. Baggage Cost Prediction**

**Concept:**
```
Baggage Fee Forecast:
Currently: $35 (1st checked bag)
Prediction: Likely to stay same
Confidence: 82%

💡 Tip: JetBlue uses dynamic baggage pricing.
       Book bags now to lock in this rate.
```

**Why:**
- KAYAK predicts flight prices, not baggage fees
- JetBlue introduced surge pricing for baggage (2024)
- Helps users make strategic decisions

---

#### **3. Baggage Bundle Optimizer**

**Concept:**
```
Your Selection: 2 passengers, 1 checked bag each
Cost: $70 (2 × $35)

💡 Smart Tip: Switch to "Blue Plus" fare ($45 upgrade)
             Includes 2 free checked bags
             Total Savings: $25
```

**Why:**
- Users don't always calculate upgrade ROI
- Increases revenue through smarter upsells
- Builds trust (helping users save money)

---

#### **4. Visual Baggage Comparison Tool**

**Concept:**
Side-by-side airline baggage policies:

```
┌─────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│             │ JetBlue  │ Spirit   │ United   │
├─────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┤
│ Personal    │ Free     │ Free     │ Free     │
│ Carry-on    │ Free     │ $41-68   │ $30      │
│ 1st checked │ $35-50   │ $46-96   │ $35      │
│ 2nd checked │ $60      │ $66-106  │ $45      │
└─────────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┘

Cheapest for your trip (1 checked): JetBlue ($35)
```

**Why:**
- Users compare fares but not baggage policies
- Spirit's variable pricing confuses travelers
- Builds trust through transparency

#### **5. Segment-Specific Warnings**

**Concept:**
```
⚠️ Notice: Baggage rules change on return flight

   Outbound (operated by JetBlue): 1 free checked bag
   Return (operated by Spirit):     $46 per checked bag

   Consider: Pack light or prepay Spirit bag to save
```

**Why:**
- Codeshare flights have different baggage rules
- **No competitor highlights this clearly**
- Prevents airport surprise fees

---

## 7. CRITICAL QUESTIONS ANSWERED

### 7.1 How do they prevent "baggage surprise" at checkout?

**KAYAK's Approach:**
- ✅ Fee Assistant shows true cost before clicking
- ✅ Hover breakdown via suitcase icon
- ⚠️ Only works if user activates toolbar
- ❌ Doesn't transfer to OTA checkout (redirect issue)

**Skyscanner's Approach:**
- ⚠️ Baggage filter shows flights with bags included
- ❌ Hidden fees common ("listed price skips baggage fees")
- ❌ 62% of users experience payment-stage surprises
- ❌ OTA redirect introduces new pricing

**Google Flights' Approach:**
- ✅ Shows baggage fees in search results
- ✅ Total price includes known fees
- ⚠️ Less detailed than KAYAK's breakdown

**Best Practice:**
Combine KAYAK's real-time calculator + Google's upfront total pricing + per-segment breakdown (innovation opportunity).

---

### 7.2 What visual language do they use (icons, colors, badges)?

**Icon Standards:**
- ✈️ **Flight/Airplane** - Universal for flights
- 🎒 **Backpack/Small bag** - Carry-on/personal item
- 💼 **Suitcase** - Checked baggage
- 🚫 **Crossed symbol** - Not included/restricted
- ✓ **Checkmark** - Included/free
- ⚠️ **Warning triangle** - Restrictions apply
- 💰 **Dollar sign** - Paid add-on

**Color Psychology:**
- 🟢 **Green** - Positive, included, free
- 🔴 **Red** - Warning, restricted, not included
- 🟠 **Orange** - Attention, paid option
- 🔵 **Blue** - Informational, neutral
- ⚫ **Gray** - Inactive, not applicable

**KAYAK Specific:**
- Red suitcase with diagonal line = Basic Economy
- Hover state for detailed breakdown
- Inline iconography with interactive elements

**Skyscanner Specific:**
- Color-coded cheapest prices (visual highlighting)
- Filter-based icon display
- Clean, minimal icon usage

**Recommendation:**
Use universal icons (suitcase = baggage) + color coding (green = included, red = restricted) + clear text labels (accessibility).

---

### 7.3 How much detail is shown before vs after expansion?

**Before Expansion (Collapsed Card):**

**KAYAK:**
- Airline logo, route, price
- Suitcase icon (hover for breakdown)
- Basic timing information
- Inline baggage indicator

**Skyscanner:**
- Price (may exclude bags)
- Basic route info
- Minimal baggage detail
- "See details" CTA

**After Expansion (Expanded Card):**

**KAYAK:**
- Flight segments with timing
- Layover details
- Aircraft type
- Baggage policy link
- Fare rules summary
- ⚠️ Still lacks per-segment baggage breakdown

**Skyscanner:**
- Segment details
- Airline information
- Baggage allowance (general)
- Link to airline for specifics
- ⚠️ No detailed breakdown inline

**Best Practice:**
- **Before expansion:** Price + suitcase icon + "1 bag included" text
- **After expansion:** Per-segment breakdown + fare comparison table + add-on calculator

---

### 7.4 How do they handle complex itineraries (multi-segment)?

**Current State (Both Platforms):**

❌ **No per-segment baggage breakdown**
❌ No visual timeline showing rule changes
❌ Unclear if bags are through-checked or require re-check
❌ Codeshare baggage policies not highlighted
❌ No warnings for inconsistent baggage across segments

**Common User Confusion:**
- "I have 1 free bag outbound, but do I on the return?"
- "My outbound is JetBlue (1 free bag) but return is Spirit (paid bags) - how does this work?"
- "If I have a layover, do I pay baggage fees twice?"

**Industry Gap:**
This is a **significant opportunity** for innovation - neither KAYAK nor Skyscanner handles this well.

**Recommended Solution:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Outbound Journey (Sep 15)                          │
│ ✈️ JFK → ATL (Delta operated)                      │
│    ✓ 1 checked bag included                        │
│ ✈️ ATL → MIA (Spirit operated - codeshare)         │
│    🚫 No free checked bag (+$46 if bag not through-checked) │
│                                                     │
│ 💡 Your bag will be through-checked to MIA - no extra fee │

│    🚫 $46 checked bag fee (prepay for $36)         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

### 7.5 What trust signals do they use for fare rules?

**KAYAK Trust Signals:**
1. **Confidence percentage** (55-95%) for price predictions
2. **Suitcase icon** with hover breakdown - transparency through interaction
3. **Fee Assistant** - proactive fee display
4. **"No change fees" badges** for eligible fares
5. **Fare rule links** - detailed policies available
6. **Statistical accuracy** - "85% accurate" claims backed by data

**Skyscanner Trust Signals:**
1. **Color-coded pricing** - cheapest options visually highlighted
2. **Baggage filter** - "only show flights with bags"
3. **Link to airline** for authoritative baggage info
4. **Price transparency disclaimer** - "final price may change due to add-ons"
5. **Reviews and ratings** from users
6. **OTA comparison** - multiple booking options with prices

**Missing Trust Signals (Opportunity):**
1. ❌ **Verified baggage policies** - "Last updated: Oct 15, 2025"
2. ❌ **Guarantee badges** - "Price match guarantee"
3. ❌ **Fee transparency certification** - third-party audit
4. ❌ **User testimonials** - "Saved $50 by seeing baggage fees upfront"
5. ❌ **Regulatory compliance** - "EU Regulation (EC) 1008/2008 compliant"

**Recommendation:**
Add trust signals like:
- "✓ All fees shown upfront - no surprises"
- "Updated daily from airline APIs"
- "Baggage policies verified [date]"

## 8. TEST SCENARIO ANALYSIS

### Test Route 1: JFK → MIA Round-Trip on JetBlue

**Baggage Policy:**
- Blue Basic: $35-50 first bag, $60 second bag
- Blue Plus: First bag free, $60 second bag
- Dynamic pricing based on departure date (peak vs. off-peak)

**KAYAK Display:**
- Fee Assistant allows selecting bag count
- Shows price difference: Blue Basic ($189) vs. Blue Plus ($234)
- Hover over suitcase icon reveals: "$35-50 1st bag depending on date"
- ⚠️ Doesn't specify exact date-based pricing

**Skyscanner Display:**
- Shows base fare without bags
- User can filter "Include 1 checked bag"
- Results update to show higher fares
- ⚠️ Doesn't explain dynamic pricing

**Recommendation for fly2any:**
```
Blue Basic: $189
  Baggage: $35 outbound (off-peak), $50 return (peak)
  Total with 1 bag: $274

Blue Plus: $234 (+$45)
  Baggage: 1 free checked bag both ways
  Total with 1 bag: $234

💡 Save $40 by upgrading to Blue Plus
```

### Test Route 2: LAX → NYC on Spirit Airlines

**Baggage Policy (Complex):**
- Carry-on: $41-68 (variable by route, date, booking method)
- First checked: $46-96 (variable)
- Second checked: $66-106
- Cheaper if booked online vs. at airport

**KAYAK Display:**
- Shows variable range: "$46-96 for 1st checked bag"
- Fee Assistant updates prices based on user selection
- ⚠️ Doesn't explain why range is so wide

**Skyscanner Display:**
- Shows Spirit as cheapest option
- Price doesn't include carry-on or checked bag
- Warning text: "Baggage fees apply"
- ⚠️ Final price can double at checkout

**User Pain Point:**
Spirit's $69 fare becomes $155 with carry-on + checked bag, making it more expensive than competitors showing $135 all-in.

**Recommendation for fly2any:**
```
Spirit: $69 base fare
  ⚠️ Carry-on bag: $55 (online)
  ⚠️ 1st checked bag: $56 (online)
  💰 Total with bags: $180

United: $135 base fare
  ✓ Carry-on included
  + $35 1st checked bag
  💰 Total with bags: $170

💡 United is actually cheaper with bags ($10 less)
```

### Test Route 3: SFO → London → Paris (Multi-City)

**Baggage Complexity:**
- SFO → LHR: Transatlantic (usually 1-2 free bags)
- LHR → CDG: European short-haul (often 0 bags)
- CDG → SFO: Transatlantic return (1-2 free bags)

**KAYAK Display:**
- Shows single price for entire itinerary
- Baggage info link leads to general airline policy
- ⚠️ No per-segment breakdown

**Skyscanner Display:**
- Displays total price
- "Baggage varies by segment" warning
- Link to check with airline
- ⚠️ User must manually research each leg

**Common User Confusion:**
"I have 2 free bags on the long flights, but do I pay $50 for the short London-Paris flight?"

**Recommendation for fly2any:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Segment 1: SFO → LHR (United)                      │
│ ✓ 2 checked bags included (transatlantic)          │
│                                                     │
│ Segment 2: LHR → CDG (British Airways)             │
│ ✓ Bags through-checked - no additional fee         │
│ ℹ️ If booked separately: £50 per bag               │
│                                                     │
│ Segment 3: CDG → SFO (United)                      │
│ ✓ 2 checked bags included (transatlantic)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

💡 Your bags will be through-checked for entire journey
```

### Test Route 4: Premium Economy vs Economy Comparison

**Baggage Difference:**
- Economy: 1 checked bag (23kg)
- Premium Economy: 2 checked bags (23kg each) + priority handling

**KAYAK Display:**
- Fare class dropdown shows both options
- "2 bags" highlighted for Premium Economy
- Price difference: +$150-300
- ⚠️ Doesn't calculate ROI for families

**Skyscanner Display:**
- Both fares shown if user filters for Premium Economy
- Baggage info in fare details
- ⚠️ No comparison tool

**Smart Recommendation for fly2any:**
```
Economy: $650 per person (family of 4)
  4 × 1 bag included = 4 bags
  Need 2 more bags = $140 extra
  Total: $2,600 + $140 = $2,740

Premium Economy: $850 per person
  4 × 2 bags included = 8 bags
  No extra fees
  Total: $3,400

Cost difference: $660 for upgrade
Value: 4 extra bags ($280) + priority boarding + extra legroom

💡 If you need extra bags, Premium Economy may not be worth it
   If you value comfort, upgrade makes sense
```
