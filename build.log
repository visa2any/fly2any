[@sentry/nextjs] It appears you've configured a `sentry.server.config.ts` file. Please ensure to put this file's content into the `register()` function of a Next.js instrumentation file instead. To ensure correct functionality of the SDK, `Sentry.init` must be called inside of an instrumentation file. Learn more about setting up an instrumentation file in Next.js: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation. You can safely delete the `sentry.server.config.ts` file afterward.
[@sentry/nextjs] It appears you've configured a `sentry.edge.config.ts` file. Please ensure to put this file's content into the `register()` function of a Next.js instrumentation file instead. To ensure correct functionality of the SDK, `Sentry.init` must be called inside of an instrumentation file.

[@sentry/nextjs] DEPRECATION WARNING: It is recommended renaming your `sentry.client.config.ts` file, or moving its content to `instrumentation-client.ts`. When using Turbopack `sentry.client.config.ts` will no longer work. Read more about the `instrumentation-client.ts` file: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/instrumentation-client
