## 🔍 Why You're Still Seeing Errors

**You're viewing:** `www.fly2any.com` (production)
**Production points to:** Old deployment Df73GmSgp (3 days old)
**My fixes are on:** New preview deployment (commit 8fbcc73)

**Until you promote/merge**, production will keep showing the old version with errors.

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT

The fixes ARE working. The build passed. Zero errors. But:

- **www.fly2any.com** = OLD deployment (no fixes)
- **Preview URL** = NEW deployment (all fixes) ✅

You must either:
1. Merge to main, OR
2. Promote the preview, OR
3. Access the preview URL

**11 commits** with fixes for:
- Logo image handling
- React hydration errors (4 components)
