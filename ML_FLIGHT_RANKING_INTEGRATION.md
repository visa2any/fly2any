# ML-Based Flight Ranking & Price Analytics Integration

## Summary
Successfully integrated Amadeus ML-based flight ranking and price analytics APIs into the flight results page. The system now uses machine learning predictions to rank flights and displays competitive pricing insights comparing each flight to market averages.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Results Page (`app/flights/results/page.tsx`)

#### Type Definitions Enhanced
```typescript
interface ScoredFlight extends FlightOffer {
  score?: number;
  badges?: any[];
  mlScore?: number; // NEW: ML-based prediction score (0-1)
  priceVsMarket?: number; // NEW: Percentage vs market average
}
```

#### New State Variables
- `marketAverage`: Stores the market average price for the route
- `mlPredictionEnabled`: Flags whether ML prediction is active (disabled on failure)

#### Flight Fetching Enhanced (Lines 310-397)
After receiving flight search results, the system now:

1. **Calls ML Prediction API** (`/api/flight-prediction`)
   - Sends all flight offers to Amadeus ML prediction endpoint
   - Receives `choiceProbability` score for each flight (0-1 range)
   - Maps scores to `mlScore` property on each flight
   - **Graceful fallback**: On error, disables ML and uses simple scoring

2. **Calls Price Analytics API** (`/api/price-analytics`)
   - Fetches market price metrics for the route
   - Extracts mean price from analytics data
   - Stores in `marketAverage` state
   - **Graceful fallback**: On error, continues without market comparison

3. **Parallel Execution**
   - Both API calls run in parallel using `Promise.all()`
   - Optimizes performance by not blocking each other

4. **Price Comparison Calculation**
   - For each flight: `priceVsMarket = ((flightPrice - avgMarketPrice) / avgMarketPrice) * 100`
   - Negative values = below market (good deal)
   - Positive values = above market (expensive)

#### Sorting Enhanced (Lines 167-195)
The "Best" sort now prioritizes ML scores:
```typescript
case 'best':
  return sorted.sort((a, b) => {
    const scoreA = a.mlScore !== undefined ? a.mlScore : (a.score || 0);
    const scoreB = b.mlScore !== undefined ? b.mlScore : (b.score || 0);
    return scoreB - scoreA;
  });
```

---

### 2. Flight Card Component (`components/flights/FlightCardEnhanced.tsx`)

#### Props Extended
```typescript
export interface EnhancedFlightCardProps {
  // ... existing props
  mlScore?: number; // NEW: ML prediction score
  priceVsMarket?: number; // NEW: Percentage vs market average
}
```

#### Score Display Updated (Lines 212-226)
- Shows ML score (0-100) when available, otherwise shows traditional IQ score
- Label changes from "IQ" to "ML" when using ML predictions
- Color coding based on score:
  - Green: ≥90 (excellent)
  - Blue: 80-89 (good)
  - Yellow: 70-79 (fair)
  - Gray: <70 (poor)

#### Price Display Enhanced (Lines 337-362)
**New Market Comparison Badge:**
- Green badge: ≤-10% (great deal)
- Blue badge: -10% to 0% (good deal)
- Yellow badge: 0% to +10% (slightly expensive)
- Red badge: >+10% (expensive)

Example displays:
- `-15% vs market` (15% below average - excellent)
- `+8% vs market` (8% above average - caution)

**Fallback Behavior:**
- If `priceVsMarket` is available, shows market comparison
- Otherwise, shows traditional savings calculation

---

### 3. Flight List Component (`components/flights/VirtualFlightList.tsx`)

#### Props Passed Through (Lines 57-58)
```typescript
mlScore={(flight as any).mlScore}
priceVsMarket={(flight as any).priceVsMarket}
```

Ensures ML scores and price comparisons are passed to individual flight cards.

---

## API Routes Utilized

### `/api/flight-prediction` (POST)
**Location:** `app/api/flight-prediction/route.ts`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "flightOffers": [...]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "choiceProbability": 0.85,
      ...flight data
    }
  ]
}
```

**Error Handling:**
- Returns original flight offers on failure
- Graceful degradation - no user-facing errors

---

### `/api/price-analytics` (GET)
**Location:** `app/api/price-analytics/route.ts`

**Query Parameters:**
- `originIataCode`: Origin airport code
- `destinationIataCode`: Destination airport code
- `departureDate`: YYYY-MM-DD format
- `currencyCode`: USD (default)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "priceMetrics": [
        {
          "mean": "450.00",
          "median": "425.00",
          "quartileFirst": "380.00",
          "quartileThird": "520.00"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Caching:**
- 6 hours cache (analytics data is relatively static)
- Reduces API calls and improves performance

**Error Handling:**
- Returns 500 error on failure
- Frontend handles gracefully by continuing without market comparison

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **ML Prediction Failure**
   - Catches error and logs warning
   - Sets `mlPredictionEnabled = false` to prevent retry
   - Falls back to original flight data with simple scoring
   - User sees flights ranked by traditional algorithm

2. **Price Analytics Failure**
   - Catches error and logs warning
   - Sets `marketAverage = null`
   - Continues without market comparison badges
   - User sees traditional "% OFF" badges instead

3. **No User Impact**
   - All failures are silent from user perspective
   - Always shows flight results
   - Degrades gracefully to simpler features

### Performance Optimizations
- **Parallel API Calls:** ML prediction and price analytics run simultaneously
- **Single Re-render:** All data processing completes before setting state
- **Caching:** Price analytics cached for 6 hours
- **Conditional Rendering:** Market badges only render when data available

### Data Flow
```
User searches →
  Flight Search API →
    Receives flights →
      Promise.all([
        ML Prediction API,
        Price Analytics API
      ]) →
        Merge results →
          Update state →
            Render cards with ML scores & market comparison
```

## Visual Changes

### Before Integration
- Flight cards showed simple "IQ" score (0-100)
- Price displayed with generic "X% OFF" badge
- Flights sorted by simple scoring algorithm

### After Integration
- Flight cards show "ML" score when predictions available
- Price displayed with "±X% vs market" badge (color-coded)
- Flights sorted by ML choice probability (more accurate)
- Market insights help users identify genuine deals

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Happy Path**
   - Search for flights
   - Verify ML scores appear (labeled "ML")
   - Verify market comparison badges show
   - Verify "Best" sort uses ML scores

2. **ML API Failure**
   - Disable `/api/flight-prediction` endpoint
   - Verify flights still appear
   - Verify traditional "IQ" scores show
   - Verify no error messages to user

3. **Price Analytics Failure**
   - Disable `/api/price-analytics` endpoint
   - Verify flights still appear
   - Verify traditional "% OFF" badges show
   - Verify no error messages to user

4. **Both APIs Fail**
   - Verify complete fallback to original behavior
   - Verify user experience is unchanged from before integration

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Price History Integration**
   - Show price trend graphs using analytics data
   - Predict optimal booking time

2. **Confidence Indicators**
   - Show ML prediction confidence level
   - Help users understand recommendation strength

3. **A/B Testing**
   - Compare ML ranking vs traditional ranking
   - Measure conversion rate improvements

4. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Use quartile data for more nuanced comparisons
   - Show "price percentile" (e.g., "Top 10% deals")
