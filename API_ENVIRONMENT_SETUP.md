# API Environment Setup - Test vs Production

## üîç Current Status: Test Mode with REAL Flight Data

Your application is currently displaying **REAL FLIGHT DATA** from the TEST/SANDBOX environment. This is the recommended setup for development.

### Important: Test Mode Shows REAL Data!

**Your `.env.local` file is configured for TEST/SANDBOX mode:**

```env
# Line 7: TEST ENVIRONMENT (real flight data, simulated bookings)
AMADEUS_ENVIRONMENT=test

# Line 12: TEST TOKEN (real flight offers, simulated payments)
DUFFEL_ACCESS_TOKEN=duffel_test_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

### Test Environment Characteristics:

‚úÖ **What Test Mode Provides:**
- **REAL flight data** - Actual prices and availability
- **REAL airline inventory** - Current market rates
- Simulated booking process (no actual tickets issued)
- Simulated payment processing (no charges)
- Free API calls (within rate limits)
- Perfect for development and testing
- Safe to test full booking flow

‚ùå **What Test Mode Doesn't Provide:**
- Actual ticket issuance
- Real payment processing
- Confirmed airline PNRs
- Customer support for bookings
- Ability to actually fly (no real tickets)

## üöÄ How to Switch to PRODUCTION (Real Data)

### Option 1: Use Amadeus Self-Service Production API

Amadeus offers production access through their self-service portal:

**Steps:**
1. **Apply for Production Access**
   - Go to: https://developers.amadeus.com/pricing
   - Sign in to your Amadeus account
   - Navigate to "My Apps" ‚Üí Select your app
   - Click "Move to Production" or "Request Production Keys"

2. **Get Production Credentials**
   - Once approved, you'll receive:
     - `AMADEUS_API_KEY` (production)
     - `AMADEUS_API_SECRET` (production)

3. **Update `.env.local`**
   ```env
   # Amadeus API (PRODUCTION Environment)
   AMADEUS_API_KEY=YOUR_PRODUCTION_KEY_HERE
   AMADEUS_API_SECRET=YOUR_PRODUCTION_SECRET_HERE
   AMADEUS_ENVIRONMENT=production  # ‚¨ÖÔ∏è CHANGE THIS
   ```

**Amadeus Production Pricing:**
- **Flight Search API:** $2.50 per 1000 requests
- **Flight Offers Price:** $3.50 per 1000 requests
- **Flight Create Orders:** $20.00 per 1000 bookings

---

### Option 2: Use Duffel Production API

Duffel provides production access immediately:

**Steps:**
1. **Upgrade to Production**
   - Go to: https://app.duffel.com/
   - Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
   - Create a new "Live" API key (starts with `duffel_live_`)

2. **Update `.env.local`**
   ```env
   # Duffel API (PRODUCTION)
   DUFFEL_ACCESS_TOKEN=duffel_live_YOUR_LIVE_TOKEN_HERE
   ```

**Duffel Production Pricing:**
- **Per Order:** $3.00 flat fee
- **Commission:** 1% of order value
- **Ancillaries:** $2.00 per ancillary service
- **Example:** $500 flight booking = $3 + $5 (1%) = $8 total cost

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Configuration

### Amadeus API
```typescript
// lib/api/amadeus.ts:35-38
this.environment = process.env.AMADEUS_ENVIRONMENT || 'test';
this.baseUrl = this.environment === 'production'
  ? 'https://api.amadeus.com'              // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Production URL
  : 'https://test.api.amadeus.com';        // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Test URL (current)
```

**Current Status:** üü° **TEST MODE**
- Base URL: `https://test.api.amadeus.com`
- Returns: Simulated flight data
- Console shows: `‚úÖ Amadeus API initialized (test environment)`

### Duffel API
```typescript
// Current token type: duffel_test_*
```

**Current Status:** üü° **TEST MODE**
- Returns: Simulated offer data
- Bookings: Not real

## üéØ Recommended Approach

### For Development (Current - KEEP AS IS):
‚úÖ Keep test credentials for development
‚úÖ Perfect for:
- Building features
- Testing integrations
- Demo purposes
- Development environment

### For Production (When Ready to Launch):
1. ‚úÖ Complete all feature development
2. ‚úÖ Test thoroughly with test credentials
3. ‚úÖ Apply for production API access
4. ‚úÖ Update environment variables
5. ‚úÖ Deploy to production
6. ‚úÖ Monitor API costs closely

## üí∞ Estimated Production Costs

**For 1000 flight searches with booking:**
- Amadeus Flight Search: $2.50
- Amadeus Price Check: $3.50
- Amadeus Booking (100 conversions): $2.00
- **Total Amadeus:** ~$8.00

**Or with Duffel:**
- Search: Free (included)
- Booking (100 conversions): $3 √ó 100 = $300
- Commission (1% of $50k): $500
- **Total Duffel:** ~$800

**Recommendation:** Use Amadeus for higher conversion rates, Duffel for ULCC coverage.

## üîê Security Note

**DO NOT commit production credentials to Git!**

Always use `.env.local` (already in `.gitignore`):
```bash
# .gitignore already includes:
.env.local
.env*.local
```

---

## üìù Quick Switch Script

Create this script if you need to switch frequently:

```bash
# switch-to-production.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Switching to PRODUCTION mode..."
sed -i 's/AMADEUS_ENVIRONMENT=test/AMADEUS_ENVIRONMENT=production/' .env.local
echo "‚úÖ Switched to production. Restart your dev server."
```

```bash
# switch-to-test.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Switching to TEST mode..."
sed -i 's/AMADEUS_ENVIRONMENT=production/AMADEUS_ENVIRONMENT=test/' .env.local
echo "‚úÖ Switched to test. Restart your dev server."
```

---

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Test data is NOT real** - Don't trust test prices for business decisions
2. **Production requires approval** - Amadeus reviews applications
3. **Monitor costs carefully** - Production APIs charge per request
4. **Rate limits differ** - Production may have different rate limits
5. **Cache aggressively** - Your app already does this (good!)

---

## ‚úÖ Verification

**To verify which mode you're in:**

1. Check console logs on startup:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Amadeus API initialized (test environment)  // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Currently here
   ‚úÖ Amadeus API initialized (production environment)  // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Production
   ```

2. Check the base URL being used:
   - Test: `https://test.api.amadeus.com`
   - Production: `https://api.amadeus.com`

3. Check flight data patterns:
   - Test: Consistent, repeatable results
   - Production: Dynamic, real-time results
