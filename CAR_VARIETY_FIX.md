# üöó CRITICAL CAR VARIETY BUG - FIXED

## üêõ BUG IDENTIFIED

**Problem:** All 8 cars showing as "Toyota Corolla" with same photo

**Root Cause:** Line 327 in `app/api/cars/featured-enhanced/route.ts`

```typescript
// BROKEN LOGIC:
demoCarModels.slice(0, Math.ceil(limit / locationsToSearch.length))
// With limit=8, locations=8: Math.ceil(8/8) = 1
// Result: Only first car (Toyota Corolla) used!
```

---

## ‚úÖ FIX APPLIED

**File:** `app/api/cars/featured-enhanced/route.ts` (Lines 326-382)

**New Logic:**
```typescript
// Generate exactly 'limit' cars, cycling through all 8 models
for (let i = 0; i < limit; i++) {
  const carIndex = i % demoCarModels.length; // Cycle through all 8 models
  const car = demoCarModels[carIndex];
  const location = locationsToSearch[i % locationsToSearch.length];
  // ... rest of car generation
}
```

**Result:** Now cycles through ALL 8 diverse vehicle types
