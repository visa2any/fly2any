# ✅ FLIGHT CARD CLEANUP COMPLETE

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Status:** 100% COMPLETE - Build Verified ✅
**File Modified:** `components/flights/FlightCardEnhanced.tsx`

---

## 🎯 USER REQUEST ADDRESSED

**Original Request:**
> "REMOVE THE OLD INFO THAT DOESN'T NEED ANY MORE FROM THE FLIGHT EXTENDED CARD PLEASE"

**Context:**
After implementing inline flight summaries (showing Flight Quality, Fare Type, Baggage, and Amenities WITH each flight leg), the old sections displaying the same information became redundant and needed to be removed.

---

## ✅ CHANGES COMPLETED

### 1. **Removed Redundant Flight Quality & Fare Type Section**

**What was removed:** The 2-column grid showing Flight Quality (On-time 83%, Comfort 4.3★) and Fare Type (LIGHT, ✅/❌ inclusions) that appeared below the flight segments.

**Why removed:** This information is now shown inline with each flight leg (outbound/return) in blue and purple gradient boxes directly WITH the flight details.

---

### 2. **Removed Redundant Premium Badges Section**

**What was removed:** The badge display section that showed airline verification and trust badges.

**Why removed:** Badge information is now part of the inline summary, and most badges were always-true hardcoded values that were already removed for transparency.

---

### 3. **Removed Duplicate "What's Included" Section**

**What was removed:** The "What's Included" column in the price breakdown grid showing carry-on, checked bags, seat selection, changes, etc.

**Why removed:** This information is now comprehensively displayed in the inline flight summary for each leg, with clearer visual indicators and per-segment accuracy.

---

### 4. **Changed Price Breakdown from 2-Column to 1-Column**

**What changed:** After removing "What's Included", the TruePrice™ Breakdown now takes full width for better readability.

---

## 📊 REMAINING SECTIONS - ALL JUSTIFIED

### **1. Deal Score Breakdown (Collapsible) ✅**
**Purpose:** Shows component-level breakdown (Price 38/40, Duration 12/15, etc.)
**Justification:** NOT redundant - provides transparency into scoring algorithm

### **2. TruePrice™ Breakdown (Full-Width) ✅**
**Purpose:** Itemized cost breakdown (Base + Taxes + Fees = Total)
**Justification:** NOT redundant - shows detailed price components

### **3. Fare Rules & Policies (Interactive Accordion) ✅**
**Purpose:** Loads detailed cancellation/change policies on demand
**Justification:** NOT redundant - comparison-stage appropriate feature

### **4. Basic Economy Restrictions Notice ✅**
**Purpose:** Important warning for restrictive fares
**Justification:** NOT redundant - legal/safety requirement
