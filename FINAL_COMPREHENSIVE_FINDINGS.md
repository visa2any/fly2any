## üêõ USER-REPORTED ISSUES - ANALYSIS

### Issue #1: "Fare breakdown when hover expands out of card area"

**LIKELY CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**

Looking at the screenshot, I see there's a **"Details" dropdown button** (blue, next to Select button). When the user hovers or clicks this, it may show a dropdown/tooltip that overflows.

**Specific Elements to Check**:
1. The "Details" dropdown button (coordinates: near top-right of expanded card)
2. The "Show Details" link under Baggage Calculator
3. The "70 Good Deal Score" badge (may have hover tooltip)
4. The "Breakdown" section scores (0/40, 0/15, etc.) - may have hover tooltips

**What Probably Happens**:
- User hovers over "Details" button or score badges
- A tooltip/dropdown appears with fare breakdown details
- The tooltip uses `position: absolute` without proper containment
- It overflows outside the flight card boundaries

**THE FIX**:

```css
/* In the tooltip/dropdown component */
.fare-details-tooltip,
.breakdown-tooltip,
[role="tooltip"] {
  position: absolute;

  /* Ensure it stays within viewport */
  max-width: min(400px, 90vw);
  max-height: min(600px, 90vh);

  /* Add proper z-index */
  z-index: 9999;

  /* Use transform for centering instead of negative margins */
  transform: translateX(-50%);
  left: 50%;

  /* Prevent overflow */
  overflow-y: auto;
  overflow-x: hidden;
}

/* For dropdowns that should stay in card */
.flight-card {
  position: relative; /* Create positioning context */
  overflow: visible; /* Allow dropdowns to show */
}

/* If dropdown needs to be clipped to card */
.flight-card-content {
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden; /* Clip overflowing content */
}
```

**Files to Edit**:
- `components/flights/FlightCardEnhanced.tsx` (line ~500-600 where Details button is)
- `components/flights/DealScoreBadge.tsx` (if it has tooltips)
- `components/ui/Tooltip.tsx` (if exists)
- Global CSS for `[role="tooltip"]`

### Issue #2: "Select button doesn't work / nothing happens"

**STATUS**: ‚úÖ **MAIN SELECT BUTTON WORKS!**

I tested the orange "Select ‚Üí" button and confirmed:
- ‚úÖ It navigates to `/flights/booking?flightId=5&adults=1...`
- ‚úÖ URL changes correctly
- ‚úÖ Toast notification appears
- ‚úÖ Console logs "Selected flight: 5"

**HOWEVER** - User may be confused about which Select button:

**Possible Confusion Points**:
1. There may be MULTIPLE "Select" buttons on the page:
   - Main flight "Select ‚Üí" (orange button) - ‚úÖ WORKS
   - Branded fare "Select" buttons in a "Compare Fares" widget - ‚ùå NOT TESTED YET
   - Filter "Select All" buttons - Different purpose

2. User might be expecting:
   - A modal to appear with fare options
   - A fare upgrade interface
   - Seat selection immediately
   - Different behavior than navigation

**NEXT STEPS TO CONFIRM**:

User needs to tell me:
1. **Which specific "Select" button are you clicking?**
   - The orange "Select ‚Üí" on the right side of each flight card? (This works)
   - A "Select" button in a "Blue Basic / Blue / Blue Plus" fare comparison widget? (Need to find this)
   - A "Select" button in the expanded details? (Would need to locate)

2. **What do you EXPECT to happen when you click it?**
   - Navigate to booking page? (Main button does this)
   - Show a modal with options?
   - Update the fare selection?
   - Something else?
