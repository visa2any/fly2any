## ❓ WHAT'S MISSING OR DIFFERENT

### Baggage Fee Calculator
**User Expects:** Expandable section with bag icon and subtitle
**Currently Have:** Baggage info shown in "What's Included" section (lines 1350-1402)
**Gap:** No dedicated expandable "Baggage Fee Calculator" section

**Possible Solutions:**
1. Create a new expandable section specifically for baggage calculator
2. Use existing BaggageFeeCalculator component (exists at `components/flights/BaggageFeeCalculator.tsx`)
3. Add a button/link to open baggage calculator modal

---

## 🔍 INVESTIGATION NEEDED

### Question 1: Are those screenshots from Fly2Any or a competitor?
The expandable sections with subtitles don't match our current design pattern (32px compact). They look more like traditional expandable accordion sections.

**If from competitor:** User wants us to implement similar features
**If from Fly2Any:** There might be another version/branch with different implementation

### Question 2: What layout style does user prefer?
**Option A:** Keep Phase 1 ultra-compact design (32px, gradients, always visible)
**Option B:** Change to expandable accordion style (like in screenshot)
**Option C:** Hybrid - some compact, some expandable

### Question 3: Which features are priority?
From user's feedback:
1. ✅ Trip Bundles - needs transfers, POI, insurance added (IN PROGRESS)
2. ⚠️ Branded Fares - exists but might not be showing (NEEDS VERIFICATION)
3. ⚠️ Seat Map - exists but might not be showing (NEEDS VERIFICATION)
4. ❓ Baggage Calculator - dedicated section requested (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Verify Phase 1 Features Are Actually Showing
Run automated test to confirm:
```bash
node test-phase-1-all-features.mjs
```

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
User should:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Expand a flight card
4. Look for logs:
   - `💎 Fetching branded fares...`
   - `💺 Fetching seat map...`
   - `🎁 Fetching trip bundles...`

### Step 3: Add Missing Baggage Calculator Section
If user wants dedicated baggage calculator:
```typescript
{/* Baggage Fee Calculator - Expandable */}
<div className="...">
  <button onClick={() => setShowBaggageCalculator(true)}>
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <Package className="w-4 h-4" />
      <div>
        <div className="font-semibold">Baggage Fee Calculator</div>
        <div className="text-xs text-gray-600">Estimate costs for extra bags</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <ChevronDown />
  </button>
</div>
```

### Step 4: Clarify Design Pattern
**Ask user:**
- Do you want the ultra-compact 32px design we implemented?
- Or traditional expandable sections like in the screenshot?
- Or a mix of both?

## 🚨 CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR USER

1. **Are those screenshots from Fly2Any or a competitor site?**
   - If competitor: We'll implement similar features
   - If Fly2Any: We need to find where that code is

2. **When you expand a flight card, what do you actually see?**
   - Do you see the 32px compact sections with gradients (💎 💺 🎁)?
   - Or expandable sections with icons and subtitles?
   - Or something else entirely?

3. **What's your preferred design?**
   - Ultra-compact always-visible (current Phase 1)
   - Expandable accordion sections (like screenshot)
   - Mix of both

4. **For Trip Bundles specifically:**
   - Did the transfers/POI/insurance fix work?
   - Can you see them in the modal now?
