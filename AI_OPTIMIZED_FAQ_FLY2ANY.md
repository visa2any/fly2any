## Booking and Availability

**Can I book a private jet for just one person?**

**Are the pilots experienced and properly certified?**
Yes, all pilots in the Fly2Any network hold current certifications and undergo regular training. Crew experience levels vary but typically include thousands of flight hours. Operator vetting includes verification of crew qualifications and training records.

## Service Details

**What's the difference between helicopter and jet charter?**
Helicopters are ideal for short urban trips or reaching destinations without runways, while jets are better for longer distances between airports. Helicopter charter is often used for airport transfers or city-to-city travel under 300 miles, while jets handle longer routes.

**Can I bring pets on private jets?**
Most private jets allow pets, though policies vary by operator. Service animals are always permitted, while pets may require advance notice. Some aircraft have specific requirements or additional cleaning fees for pet travel.

**Is food and drink included on private flights?**
Basic catering and beverages are typically included in charter quotes. Premium meal options, special dietary requests, or specific beverage preferences can be arranged for additional costs. Travelers can discuss catering needs during the booking process.

## Suitability and Use Cases

**Who is private jet charter best suited for?**
Private aviation works well for business travelers needing multiple stops in one day, families traveling to remote destinations, time-sensitive travelers, and those valuing privacy. It's particularly useful when commercial airline schedules don't match travel needs.

**When does it make sense to charter a helicopter instead of a jet?**
Helicopters are practical for distances under 300 miles, urban airport transfers avoiding traffic, or reaching locations without runways. They're commonly used for trips between Manhattan and JFK, city-center to city-center travel, or accessing island destinations.

**What are the main advantages over commercial airlines?**
Key advantages include time savings through smaller airports, flexible scheduling, privacy, direct routing without connections, and comfort. The total door-to-door travel time is often significantly reduced compared to commercial options.

**Are there any destinations Fly2Any doesn't serve?**
While Fly2Any primarily focuses on U.S. destinations, international flights can be arranged through partner operators. Some remote international locations or countries with complex aviation regulations may have limited availability or require additional planning.

**How does Fly2Any compare to traditional charter brokers?**
Fly2Any uses technology for quick bookings with no long-term commitments, while traditional brokers often work through personal relationships and may require jet cards or memberships. The platform approach suits occasional travelers, while traditional brokers may benefit frequent flyers.
