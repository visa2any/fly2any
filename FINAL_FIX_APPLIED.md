# ✅ FINAL FIX APPLIED - Deal Score Breakdown

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Issue Resolved**: Hover tooltip overflow and poor UX

---

## 🎯 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

The user reported: *"the fare breakdown when hover the card with mouse is expanding completely out of the card area... whats the point we hover the card and it popup like that? its not good the name is Deal Score Breakdown"*

**Root Cause**:
- The Deal Score Breakdown was implemented as a **hover tooltip**
- This caused:
  1. Overflow issues (extending beyond card boundaries)
  2. Poor UX (information hidden until hover)
  3. Confusion (why hide important breakdown information?)

---

## ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Removed Hover Tooltip
**File**: `components/flights/FlightCardEnhanced.tsx`
- Removed `DealScoreBadgeCompact` component (which had hover tooltip)
- Replaced with inline badge display - NO tooltip

### 2. Added Inline Breakdown Display
**Location**: Expanded flight card details (always visible when card is expanded)
**Display**:
```
Deal Score Breakdown
├── Price (0/40) - Best deal on this route
├── Duration (0/15) - Optimal flight time
├── Stops (0/15) - Direct/1 stop/etc
├── Time of Day (0/10) - Convenient departure
├── Reliability (0/10) - 85% on-time
├── Comfort (0/5) - Standard comfort
├── Availability (0/5) - 9 seats left
└── Total Score: 70/100
```
