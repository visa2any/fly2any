## Implementation

To transform any of these "BEFORE" examples to "AFTER":

```typescript
import { processAIResponse } from '@/lib/ai';

const roboticResponse = "I will search for flights. Please wait.";

const naturalResponse = processAIResponse(roboticResponse, {
  consultantTeam: 'flight-operations',
  userName: 'Sarah',
  isFirstMessage: true,
});

console.log(naturalResponse);
// "Good morning, Sarah! I'd be happy to find flights for you!"
```

The transformation is automatic, intelligent, and context-aware!
